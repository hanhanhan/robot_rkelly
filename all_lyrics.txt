But I done told you time and time again

Whatever you're going through

You can come and talk to me

And I will say a prayer with you
But I done prayed and prayed night and day

I still can't seem to find my way
Rob that ain't nothing but the devil telling you

That you're washed up and you're through

But sister's here to let you know

Boy you're gonna make it through
Sister, do you really believe that I can rise again
Yes, and not only that, Rob, God will forgive you for your sins
Can you tell me what to do?
Well first you gotta believe the truth
Sometimes it's hard to believe in Him
That's okay because he believes in you
The winds, the rain

The storm

The weapons that are formed against us I will survive

The trying times

The sleepless nights

Just know that faith is with us and I believe yeah

Through all of the hills

And valleys roamed

That we must come to woah

Walk side by side

Follow the light

And we'll make it through We'll make it through yeah
So, so what you're saying is believe a little more?
Yes, cause faith is the key that will opens up the door
What you're saying to me, it's hard to receive

Especially when trouble follows me
When we're keeping it real

Robert sometimes

Trouble can follow where you lead
Yes sister, I know sometimes, but I
Just wait, let me make a phone call
To who?
A prayer buddy of mine

She can help you tear down your walls
I don't want nobody in my business
She's a friend

And besides you need this
You know how church folk can be
Boy I'm your sister, trust in me
Mm
Now hold on
Maybe she's gone
No
Maybe we ought to just try...

Yes, I think she's around here somewhere

Hold on
Now you just let me do the talking
Mm hmm
Hello?
Hey girl, how you doing?
Hey Kelly
My little brother's on the line and needed advice from you
Ooh what can I do for you?

Hello?
Go ahead Rob, she's talking to you
Oh, well, I know you must be very busy

So I'm not going to mess around, nah

Just telling my sister how my life is upside down

And I don't know whether I'm going left or right half the time

Sometimes think I'm gonna lose my mind, you feel me?
Mm hmm, similar to what I used to go through
Really?
Yes, and sometimes I still do
Yeah?
See it doesn't matter who you are

Or where you're from

If you struggle, God will use you
Amen sister, what you're saying is so true

Rob are you there?
Yes, I'm just listening to the both of you

It's so easy to say, but not so easy to do
Yes but if you stand the truth

It will free you
Oh
Just stand strong
Stand strong
With your head held high
With your head held high
Said it wont be long

In time he will provide
Will he?
Yes he will
You just stay in the race
Just stay in the race
And keep on running
And down to the end
Cause your day is coming
The winds, the rain

The storm

The weapons that are formed against us

The trying times

The sleepless nights

Just know that faith is with us

Through all of the hills

And valleys roamed

That we must come to

Walk side by side

Follow the light

And we'll make it through
He'll give you peace

In the midst of your storm
Sometimes I feel like it's too late for me
But he'll never leave you
No way
You just gotta hang on
Hang on
Robert say a prayer, keep your head

God will do just what he said
Finally I think I get it
Yes, that's it

That's the spirit
The winds, the rain

The storm

The weapons that are formed against us

The trying times

The sleepless nights

Just know that faith is with us

Through all of the hills

And valleys roamed

That we must come to

Walk side by side

Follow the light

And we'll make it through

The winds, the rain

The storm

The weapons that are formed against us

The trying times

The sleepless nights

Just know that faith is with us

Through all of the hills

And valleys roamed

That we must come to

Walk side by side

Follow the light

And we'll make it through

The winds, the rain

The storm

The weapons that are formed against us

The trying times

The sleepless nights

Just know that faith is with us

I know we all have our problems

And tryin to make it better

So I had to put on my music cake

And write this Love Letter!

Come on baby

Dance, step, move whatever Repeats

Merry Christmas y'all!
 


All hope was gone

Hard to hang on

Hard to be strong

Was blind, could not see

Nothing but walls in front of me

And inside no peace
And the mountains seemed

Impossible to climb until
You stood on the front lines

You led the way out of the darkness

We didn't go astray

You were ready to die for our sake

And that takes a soldier's heart
Oceans so deep

Uphill so steep

But still we believe

And when the road was too far to travel

Heroes you came and carried us there
And the mountains seemed

Impossible to climb until
You stood on the front lines

You led the way out of the darkness

We didn't go astray

You were ready to die for our sake

And that takes a soldier's heart
And so our flag was still there

All because you decided to care
You stood on the front lines

You led the way out of the darkness

We didn't go astray

You were ready to die for our sake

And that takes a soldier's heart
You stood on the front lines

You led the way out of the darkness

We didn't go astray

You were ready to die for our sake

And that takes a soldier's heart
You stood on the front lines

You led the way, out of the darkness

You could have let us go astray

You were ready to die for our sake

And that takes a soldier's heart

And that takes a soldier's heart
 


My time, my patience, my love

My blood, my sweat, my tears

My burdens, my drama, my pain

My car, my money, my home

My ups, my downs, my fears

And my hours, my work, my strength

My fault, my this, my that

Nigga please
 

If you don't stop

This is a warning

Someone's gonna lay in your bed

This is a warning

And someone's gonna eat your food

This is a warning

And someone's gonna wear your clothes

This is a warning

And someone's gonna fit your shoes

This is a warning

And someone's gonna get your keys

This is a warning

And someone's gonna open your doors

This is a warning

Someone's gonna get your check

This is a warning

This is a woman's threat

Baby, this is a woman's threat
My shakin  my sleep, my stress

My days, my night, my rest

My do's, my don'ts, my dares

And my church, my pastor, my prayers

My all, my faith, my powers

And my kitchen, my sink, my towels

My joy, my sad, my hate

And my sister, my cousin, my friends

My lights, my gas, my bills

My role, my way, my will

My hollerin  my fussin  my fights

Nigga please
 
My future, my hopes, my dreams

My panties, my socks, my things

My flowers, my dress, my ring

My man, my lover, my king

My live, my chance, my fault

And my guts, my courage, my wounds

My fence, my neighbors, my yard

My chains, my lock, my guards

My win, my lose, my gain

And my credit, my card, my name

Myself, my freedom, my roof

Nigga please

In the tele suite

Then there was you what what

And I don't wanna be a player no more

Every night in the club trickin with a different girl thought I'd never fall in love what what

Then I met you what what

Girl you changed my mind
Walk up in the club

Saw her in the club

At first sight I fell in love

I'm not supposed to be falling in love

Cause I'm a hustler and a player

But she has the baddest body to me

Prettiest eyes I ever did see

Her smile had me going as soon as she did it

Cause shawty got a booty and man I gotta hit it

Lil mama doing her thing and I love it

On the phone making the swing and I love it

Get close and she don't mind when I rub it

And I can hit it when I want it
She might be my lover

She makes me want no other

She don't care if I go to the strip club

She wanna go too

I never met a girl like you that makes me want to settle down

Every night up in the club getting money with the thugs thought I'd never fall in love what what

Then there was you what what

And I don't wanna be a player no more

Every night in the club trickin with a different girl thought I'd never fall in love what what

Then I met you what what

Girl you changed my mind
Imma spend my money on her

Pop champagne in the club with her

Hit the mall and take her shopping

I don't know, maybe some diamonds for her

Cause she deserves a real balla in her life

And I'm that man

So if you feel me ladies

Let me see your hands
She might be my lover

She makes me want no other

She don't care if I go to the strip club

She wanna go too

I never met a girl like you that makes me want to settle down

Every night up in the club getting money with the thugs thought I'd never fall in love what what

Then there was you what what

And I don't wanna be a player no more

Every night in the club trickin with a different girl thought I'd never fall in love what what

Then I met you what what

Girl you changed my mind
Cause none of these chicks can fuck with my baby

None of these chicks can fuck with my baby

And none of these chicks can fuck with my baby

Fuck with my baby, fuck with my baby

None of these chicks can fuck with my baby

None of these chicks can fuck with my baby

None of these chicks can fuck with my baby

Fuck with my baby, fuck with my baby
Every night up in the club getting money with the thugs thought I'd never fall in love what what

Then there was you what what

And I don't wanna be a player no more

Every night in the club trickin with a different girl thought I'd never fall in love what what

Then I met you what what

Girl you changed my mind
 


 

No mountain's too high for you to climb

All you have to do is have some climbing faith

No river's too wide for you to make it across

All you have to do is believe it when you pray
 

And then you will see the morning will come

and everyday will be bright as the sun

All of your fears cast them on me

I just want you to see
 

I'll be your cloud up in the sky

I'll be your shoulder when you cry

I hear your voices when you call me

I am your Angel,

And when all hope is gone, I'm here

No matter how far you are, I'm near

It makes no difference who you are

I am your Angel, I'm your Angel
 

I saw your tear drops and I heard you cry

All you need is time, seek me and you shall find

You have everything and you're still lonely

It don't have to be this way

Let me show you a better day
 

And then you will see, the morning will come

And all of your days will be bright as the sun

So all of your fears just cast them on me

How can I make you see
 
 

And when it's time to face the storm
 

I'll be right by your side
 

Grace will keep us safe and warm

And I know we will survive
 

And when it seems as if your end is drawing near end is drawing near

Don't you dare give up the fight

Just put your trust beyond the skies

As I look into my life

Searching for that paradise
Oh Lord will you help me, find me

Take this crazy ghetto past of mine

And put it all behind me

Look down on the ghetto man

And change his mission

And put it in the hearts

Of many to stop confusion
 

My sistas, brothas

Let's put these hands together

We need to stop chokin on the truth

And start smokin on a plan man

Love and respect that woman

And bring her happiness

For each other we should help

While our babies are dying in the street

We've got to be saying to ourselves

You're running from me all the time
Baby hear me, I never meant to hurt you

I only wanted you to be happy

You to have the best of things

To be down with me, baby

Cause your lovin  it's so good
You're giving me the run-around

Thought our love was going down

Baby hear me, never meant to hurt you

Now you know I'll never do anything to hurt you

Cause baby I love you
Every night and day I pray

Your love returns

If it would only make you happy
 

Sittin reminiscin on when you started dissin 
Spittin in faces in public places

Rolexes with faces had you chipper for months

Made some dough, did some shows, now you're starting to front

Smokin blunts on the veranda with Amanda

She's fillin your head with he said, she said

Poppa doin this, Poppa doin that

But don't tell him I said it cause my Jeep might get wetted

Forget it, go on take her word like the Koran

Y'all stay friends, I'll stay and smoke Phil Benzs

Honeysuckle sets, Biggie secret pyjama sets

You were the Reebok vandal, now you were Chanel sandals

I made you, why would I play you?

Think about it while the streets you roam

It's all peas and crispies in the fridge when you get home
 

You to be, be happy

You to have the best of things

Baby everything you want it for baby

You to be down with me

So give me that ass back baby

Cause your lovin is so good, so damn good, babe
Everyday and night I pray love will swing you back this way

Life without you here with me ain't the same without you G

I've been kickin it with your girlfriend

Oh what am I gonna do?

Cause God knows that I really didn't mean to hurt you

I know it's bogus, but I felt that you should know the truth

I fell in love with her the moment that we were introduced

And I just feel that it's time for this little secret to end

Baby, I've been kickin it with your girlfriend
Go ahead and slap me again, cause I can understand how you feel

When a man takes you for granted and he don't keep it real

I should've been a man and told you a long time ago

Instead of stunnin I should have broke it down and let you know

Girl my fault for that, don't know what's on my mind

And I blame myself for wastin your time

Believe, I really did try to keep that girl away from me

But her body language kept on tempin and teasin me

And plus she knew what she was doin when she did it anyway

I knew what she was doin too and that made it okay

Truth is that we don't even regret it

Up out the closet I will be the first to say it
 
Now I apologize for me and her and everything that went down

These are the reasons why some girls don't bring they friends around

I just didn't know how to tell you that I was feelin her

And how we get away sometimes and make love

I never wanted to dislead you

At first I just wanted to please you

I know it's hard for you to be able to trust again

Because I came between you and your best friend

I did not ask for this

It just happened outta no where since the day we kissed

And the truth is that we don't even regret it

Up out the closet, I will be the first to say it
 
I'm sorry again

Never meant to hurt you

I'm sorry again

But girl I love her

I'm sorry again

I never meant to make you cry, no

The first one out the closet

I been around the world

And gets nothing but love

For who I am

I thank my fans so much

Even though some may hate

Still I appreciate

All my friends and family

That kept it real with me
I been around the world and back like what up

East side to west side touring like what up

And even though the price for the house was so much

I still roll with them from the hood like what up

Cause when it comes to being the realest I'm sure nough

I'm a straight up industry villain for sure nough

And I can't satisfy some a y'all no matter what

And some of y'all cats are so jealous

Said we livin in a cold cold world

Ain't nothin but fake faces fake people fake friends

Said we living in a cold cold world

Where there ain't nuttin but envy wannabees playa-hatas

Yea I know I need a hug but y'all need a hug too

cause god gunna judge me the same day he judge you

And even though we have our struggles that's alright

You know we get our folks and find a way to shine
 
 

Sometimes this world can be so cold

When you looking through the windows of the soul

I been looking to see the truth as it unfolds

Cause I been around this globe and back

Enough to know the fact

Who loves me

And who loves me not

We be shit's so hot

You could put it in red tops

And pump it through every hood, ghetto, and block

Until they heart stops

That's why they fiend for me

And I thank you for every blessing that you giving me lord

And I'm grateful for all my talent and my vocal accords

And all these haters I keep shaking em off

Rubbing they face in fame

I'm sorry I changed the game

But its mine and I can't complain

Rule and are Kelly

Been around the world

Putting it on women

Bumping and grinding these bitches

But we always on time when a woman fed up

And that's love

That's why they all fuck wit us
 
Said my lyrics is my testimony

That's how I live

I had to get rid of a lot of fake homies

Over the years

You see me on TV sometimes

Not how it is

Y'all gotta start learning how to separate me from showbiz

When I'm rolling through your city

Show me love

And ladies when you see a boy

Give me love

And though I'm not conceited right

Its just my space sometimes I need it right

Said I got so many friends in them area codes

That I hand out them tickets when it comes to my shows

Ja lets break bread together

Pray together

That we grow strong together

Its clear forever

Help each other through the stormy weather

Lets hurt together

Lets cry together

And even if we grow together

Then together we'll make it better
 
Said I been around the world

And gets nothing but love

For who I am

I thank my fans so much

Even though some may hate

Still I appreciate

You and me, havin sex

After an argument, that shit's the best

You and me, havin sex yeahh

After an argument, that shit's the best

Think about it while the streets you roam

It's Dom P and Army in the fridge when you get home
I storm in, she storm out

It's like the "War of the Roses" goin on in my house

It's a little separation but I know how to fix the situation

Mami just sufferin from love deprevation

So I gotta give her thug reperations

Put it in the life until love leg is shakin

Slow and passionate, til we forget what happens

Then we laughin and we back friends
You don't have to fuss and fight

Why don't you just spend the night

Baby let's just kiss and hug

You know the words girl let's make up

So much love to be made

Instead of screamin, "Who's to blame?"

Girl I don't wanna let you go, I need you so
 
Girlfriend didn't believe me when I said I'd be back in a little

Cause I had the Chris T on with the crease in the middle

Plus a fresh cut and the freezin icicles

On my wrist, on my hand, that's when shit hit the fan

Said, "You never spend timey, what's up with that?"

Translated it means

Hit it hard from the back

Yeah she hid my car keys

And forced me to fall asleep to her heartbeat
 
I don't want baby I don't want to fight

I just want to make it right ooh yeah

Put out problems to the side

Let's just make sweet love tonight I don't want

Baby I don't want to fight

I just want to make it right ohhhhh love

Put our problems to the side

Let's just make sweet love tonight
Sex so intense, all that's on my mind

It ain't feel this good since the very first time

I'm pullin her close, she's pullin away

I'm tryin to kiss her mouth but she keeps turnin her face

Cute sex game like our very first date

We ain't know each other well enough, we had to wait

But oh! I know just where your hot spot at

You can not deny that, so do not try that

I do not buy that

Baby, I never seen nobody like you

You're a good friend, you know, you've been there for me

From the beginning, that's why I love you

I mean I place no one above you, no what I'm sayin 

Anything you want, you just come to Daddy

Listen
When I discovered you I discovered a piece within

A joy like no other, you are my closest friend

Girl, if you were a number you'd be a perfect 10

Right out of the blue sky you were heaven sent

The way we make love over and over again

If I had to describe it there'd be nowhere to begin

And I'm so proud to be your next of kin

Bring a train over me when I had no reason
 

Oh, plenty caramel coated taffies

Chocolate covered strawberries

Love so sweet

You're my chocolate factory

Gumdrops mixed with chocolate milk bars

There's so much variety, love so sweet

You're my chocolate factory
Now if I could write a book on how you made me feel

The title would read a strong black man and that's for real

I been going round and round just like a Ferris wheel

And in and out of relationships with out appeal

Ain't nobody else on Gods green earth for me

If we turn ourselves together, we'll make the perfect team of dreams

Change me for the world as long as I exist

Always in the kitchen cookin up my favorite meal
 
You're that puzzle piece that completes me girl something so sweet

Girl you're everything girl you're everything that I need

You're my escape when I want to be free when I want to be free

You full of plenty treats like peppers and sweet tarts, big blue red hot

Baby you are

TrackMasters uhh... turn the music up

So I called her mother's house

And asked her had she seen my baby

Roll my 6 around, lookin for that missin lady

Got back in turned the TV on and caught the news

And I put my hand on my head cause I'm so confused
And then I turned the TV down

Cause I thought I heard a squeaky sound

Somethings goin on upstairs, yeah

Cause I know nobody else lives here
Bomp, bomp, bomp

As I get closer to the stair ways, all I hear

And then I hear my Baby's voice, in my ear

Screamin out

Said a prayer cause only God knows what I'm gonna do

Who would have thought she was creepin with another man

The down low happened to me all over again
And then I turned the TV down

Cause I know I heard a squeaky sound

Somethin goin on upstairs, yeah

Cause I know that no one else lives here
Bomp, bomp, bomp

As I get closer to the stair ways, all I hear

Mansions await, your scent

Dining with me in suites

That overlooks the shore
 

As we move, then we touch, then we dip

Dancin with a rich man

As we move, then we touch, then we dip

Shall we dance, shall we dance, shall we dance

As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss

Dancin with a rich man

As we turn, then we stare, then we kiss
Kissing the feet of you

While listening to Bonsois

And your angelic brace

Wearing Victoria

Passionate love with you

Hearing you "Oh, oui oui"

Some antique jewelry from

Kenshire's gallery
 
And when you elevate

Like visions of grandeur

Mademoiselle and me

Behind the villa doors

Sunsets on yellow sand

That's where we rendezvous

Chapels of Valentine

Is just to name a few

Did you ever think that you would be this rich

Did you ever think that you would have these hits

Did you ever think that you would be the don

Have a crib with a fifty acre lawn

Did you ever think that you would be this paid

Were there times when your ass was real afraid

Did you ever think that you would sell out tours

Have a show with fifty million viewers
I used to think about how I was gonna make it

Struggling day to day just trying to get this paper

Hoping the day would come when things would go my way

But now I'm living lavish and all I do is hear them say
 
Now I've been around the world and seen so many things

Partied in every club nothing but VIP

I never take for granted these luxuries I have

Just try my best to answer all of these questions that I ask
 
I used to play the game, at night the same old same

Dreamin bout city lights it was my only lie

And now it's world wide shows

As if I can fly on over

Now I can't go nowhere without, before I do two more
 
I used to dream about this life

Now I'm sitting on first class flights

Now they all wanna know

Let's do this dirty laundry, this dirty laundry

Let's do this dirty laundry, this dirty laundry

When you're soaked in tears for years, it never airs out

When you make pain look this good it never wears out

This dirty laundry, this dirty laundry
While my sister was on stage, killing it like a motherfucker

I was enraged, feeling it like a motherfucker

Bird in a cage, you would never know what I was dealing with

Went our separate ways, but I was happy she was killing it

Bitter, sweet, she was up, I was down

No lie, I feel good for her, but what do I do now?

Forget the records, off the record, I was going through some bullshit

Post Survivor, she on fire, who wanna hear my bullshit?

Meanwhile this nigga putting his hands on me

I swear y'all don't know the half of this industry
Let's do this dirty laundry, this dirty laundry

Let's do this dirty laundry, this dirty laundry

When you're soaked in tears for years, it never airs out

When you make pain look this good it never wears out

This dirty laundry, this dirty laundry
And it's almost been a decade

I'm behind them black shades

Roll up like it's all good, right up out that escalate

Fix my make-up,

"get it together, Kelly, get it together"

Then we make up,

Well get it together, nigga, get it together

Kinda lucky, I was in her shadow

Phone call from my sister, "what's the matter?"

She said, "Oh no baby, you gotta leave!"

I'm on the kitchen floor, he took the keys

I was mad at everybody,

I mean everybody

Yeah, her, her, her, her everybody

Five years later, I got my shit down phat

Think I had it good, and they don't know how bad

Fooled everybody,

Except myself, soaking in this hurt

Bathing in the dirt
Dirty laundry, this dirty laundry

Let's do this dirty laundry, this dirty laundry

When you're soaked in tears for years, it never airs out

When you make pain look this good it never wears out

Dirty laundry,

laundry
So here I am in the spin cycle

We're coming and we're going, nobody can notice

And I was trapped in his house, lying to my mama

Thought it could get no worser as we maximize the drama

Started to call them people on him

I was battered

He hittin the window like it was me, until it shattered

He pulled me out, he said, "Don't nobody love you but me

Not your mama, not your daddy and especially not B."

He turned me against my sister

I missed you
Let's do this dirty laundry, this dirty laundry

This dirty laundry, this dirty laundry

When you're soaked in tears for years, it never airs out

When you make pain look this good it never wears out

This dirty laundry, dirty laundry
Love is pain and pain is love,

He had me fucked up

Love is pain and pain is love,

He had me fucked up
 


R. Kelly - Doin Dishes Lyrics

Doin Dishes by R. Kelly Lyrics
 


 

Unstoppable, Trackmasters, Rockland, come on
 

Na-na so sick, make your toes twitch

Get up in yo ass and ride that shit

Oh yeah, dare you act shady with the first lady?

Let's go half on this baby

Inner thighs thick so when we fuck you must put me in a Swiss ho 
Room 704, fuck they mad at me fo 

Skin copper, na-na stay proper, who could stop her?

Nothin  Hey, do a somersault

All that platinum shit you bought?

Nigga, fuck you thought, it ain't my fault

Keep the wrist rocky, attitude cocky

Next time you see me, address me like "Miss Foxy"

It's for the wrist cop it, if it's a six drop it

Thongs with topless how you like that Robbie?

Ain't nothing sweet, you know my style, doggy style

From the back, in the back, hit it like that
 

The dollar bill
 

Nothin but stacks get you anything

Anywhere, as a matter of fact, dollar bill
 

Say what you want baby

While you be stalling at the lights

We be dippin in Mercedes
 

Dollar bill
 

Can get us from here to Rio

In two hours first class still time to take a shower

The dollar bill
 

Where ever we be it's VIP stats, no doubt

So what y'all cats know about that
 

Say lady, I'm liking what I see

Come on and talk to me baby, baby, baby

Can't you see one night is all I need

We'll go somewhere and be

Talkin about your future plans with me
 

I would do anything

To have you in my life, that's right

We can take a flight out of here go anywhere
 

Uh uh, I got proof rims on the V-12

Make you raise the roof, no gold in the tooth

Put some in the vault CD's overseas

Private lofts, I'm you haters holocaust

Ain't my fault I rap, then still made a mill 
But it's my fault I got my own label deal

Vacation in Japan while you wish for Bennihana's

On the way to pick up Madona, the ill na-na
 

Now you know the na-na plays with the big boys, aye'day

From the six coupe to the big Royce, can you handle that?

A lotta sass and ass with that

And I'm strickly for the dough

So fuck you think I'm here fo 

Princesses in a row, row platinum status

Ice lace to pink face

Then I back the faggots

See me rocking aye'thang from Mongolians to Persians

Y'all still learning, I got Â¡Rem swervin  through a sermon

And there's nothin you can tell me bout these cats that I

Don't even ram through a plan, too much stack

Must I continue this?

Might be a couple of cats that I miss

We could skip the french kiss, take it straight to the wrist

And it gets no iller than this

Na-na engraved on canary ice, see me wear it twice

Did y'all niggas hear me right?

Me and Kelly put the lock down on New York to Chitown

His town to my town, for the dollar bill
 

The dollar bill
 

Tell me who that said that we couldn't rock

I roll the dice, bet the dots say we won't stop

I roll from Chitown to Cali, hit your block

I bless the day that R&B music meet hip hop

You haters thought that Kelly couldn't keep it hot

Even when I'm in your face, y'all see me not

Sportin nothing but the rocks, navigators on the block

Merridian CD's with five TV's

College honeys follow in your GS3

We on the way to IHOP, coming from the spot

Niggas in the lot jammin to the knock

Y'all mad cause you can't get what we got

Who's the number one contender, January through December?

Cut your forest down while you niggas screamin Timothy

Sophia know me from the beach house in Miami

Banks know me, so I could give a damn about the Grammies
 

The dollar bill

Dollar bill y'all, dollar bill y'all, dollar bill y'all

The dollar bill

Dollar bill y'all, dollar bill y'all, dollar bill y'all

History runs pretty deep with you and me

There were times we thought it ended

Times we fought out in the street
And baby, we, we knocked each other upside down

Yeah, the winds of change are blowing wide

Rumors got around
We rise and we fall

We get back up and try our luck

And I can't explain

What it is I feel, but I know it's real
I keep holding on to you, I don't know

Why I gotta have you but I do

I don't know

Why I gotta have you but I do
Don't know why but it happens every day

Some folks call it leaving

Some folks call it running away
Here I am and I'll say these words out loud

I always hope I'll find a way

One step from the crowd
We rise and we fall

We get back up and try our luck

And I can't explain

What it is I feel, but I know it's real
I keep holding on to you, I don't know

Why I gotta have you but I do
We rise and we fall

We get back up and try our luck

And I can't explain

What it is I feel, but I know it's real
I keep holding on to you, I don't know

Why I gotta have you but I do

I don't know

Why I gotta have you but I do
I don't know

Why I gotta have you but I do

Amen!
Jeah! back blocked on everybody laptop

Hittin niggas from da shower, hold a note like da guy who said da British is comin 
Oh yeah da niggas is comin get out ya good dishes or somethin like it's thanksgiving

And non other than da "are" and without further a due like Freddy get ready it's .....
Whatever happen Lord, don't pass me by

Cause whenever I did wrong it was ya name I cried

I heard you forgave over and over again

But when I found out I love you, you became ammune to my sins

Laid wide awake in da middle of my sleep I see dead people

And sometimes it's me Lord

I never wanted to be a thug father

I only wanted to be a son of a father

That's how it sounds inside, worse than da war in Iraq, when it's me against I

I gave up da weed and somehow I'm still high

Three years still seein them three guys lord whoo

Sometimes I don't know what you want from me, but I do know you know what I want from you

Give it to me

Come on take away this Hennessey, take away me runnin da streets

Stop people from rapin me, take away all this jealously and prejudicy

Lord you said it was better place, I grew up around pimps, hustlers, hoes and project gates

It's hard to believe in what I can't see

I got to get this money and feed my family
Whatever in me guides my life, dear lord don't let me die tonight

But if I shall before I wake, what shall I say

Its been a good run from hoodlum to outin da states

How could one who made so much foul mistakes, still be allowed to have a smile on my face

How whatever da case I'm glad it wasn't murder, in a town you never heard of

From a nickel plated burner

Now my life straight like a perm, tried to take da spot I earn

Muthafucka better learn
 

Back blocked on everybody laptop

Hit niggas from da shower, hold a note like da guy who said da british is comin 
Oh yeah da niggas is comin get out ya good dishes or somethin like its thanksgiving

And non other than da "are" and without further a due like freddy get ready
Lord hear me out, got a few more things to say

These demons be chasin me like everyday come here

Nah my life on crutches, never say I never walk again

But da devil is a lie cause I believe within 
You're da reason that I'm still here, even though I don't act like it

Even though I hear my callin and fight it

Fools do me so wrong, its hard to stay righteous

Pimpin was allowed to happen I'll hide it

Believe me lord I want you, got money and fame but still it just won't do

Sometimes I don't like who I am, when I look in da mirror my reflection is uncle sam uncle sam

And every night I have these weird dreams, that a preacher trapped inside of me wake up and can't

Breathe

I feel like its twenty of me, goin twenty different directions on a one way street lord

I got houses, money and cars, and met every single superstar

I got da whole music industry sold, but it still don't matter
When I'm gone and my casket closed!
Whatever in me guides my life, dear lord don't let me die tonight

But if I shall before I wake, I'd accept my fate

I did what I did my heart was in da right place ohhh

I guess so I can live it put food on my plate

You must still love me not to let it in by three that day

Well whatever da case I'm glad it wasn't murder, in a town you never heard of

From a nickel plated burner

I guess I'm not finished wit my journey, please forgive me for my sins

Shit I'm still tryna learn me

Oh yeah da niggas is comin get out ya good dishes or somethin like its thanksgiving

And non other than da "are" and without further a due like Freddy get ready
Many men whoo have come and gone in these streets feel me

Walked alone in these streets ohhh waitin to hear from you come on lord

Oh lord,whoowrap your arms wrap your arms around us godaround da hood

Lift every peace from war, bring our soldiers home, let us pray

I don't believe the shit I did the night we were at your mom's

I got a page from out of town, lied and said it was my job

Grabbed my hat, coat, gloves and scarf

I told you that I would return

But by the look upon your face you had already discerned

You pulled me to the side and you begged for me to stay

But I was caught up in a life that forced me to walk away
 
Okay you, you're saying you came in and

And these two women they, they poured

Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, it wasn't nothing like that

All I know is uh, I was asleep, they came in

Woke me up pourin hot grits

And all kinds of shit on me man, okay beatin me and shit

Hittin me with all sorts of type shit Damn
With a cigar in my mouth over Vegas city lights

On a path way up the hill to be with my other wife

A rich nigga living strife going on like nothing's wrong

But that damn Caller ID is the reason for this song

So one called up the other while I was out playing some golf

Talking about my doggish ways and how I need to be dropped off
 
Now go ahead, shoot me now because I'm guilty as sin

Playin Russian roulette with hearts not to mention the kids

Now every day I live I regret all that I did

Out smoking with friends as I reminisced
 
I can't take it no more I've got to confess

See now, I don't know why

I thought that I could keep creeping

cause you see what goes around

Comes back on around and back on around

And back on around again, yes it does

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

In a state of shock that's what it left me

Take it from a man who knows

That three ain't company

No, no, no that's what I kept telling myself

Now I done lost the houses the kids and the dogs

Now I'm sleeping in my momma's house

And even she says, your sorry ass don't deserve no help

Must be because of what my old man did to her

Niggas

Seems like we're done here

Looks like that's everything

She walks by, one last time,

Checks for her things and leave the keys behind

There will be more tears

As she's beginning to drive away

Its all clear now, there's no real reason to have the pain

Now I know love has kept me here, and my pride has kept me here

And hope keeps singing it's alright, I'll be fine
But she'll be going elsewhere

And she'll be lying else where

And she'll be wanted elsewhere

And I'll be somewhere thinking about her

And she'll be living elsewhere

And she'll be laughing elsewhere

And shell be happy elsewhere

And I'll be just fine without her, someday
That's what I keep telling myself
Was it the right thing

Was this our biggest mistake

Still call sometimes but she's got nothing to say, And still she stays away

It's got me questioning, if I ever meant the same to her

How could she, Why would she

Do these things put me through this pain now

If love is what we have then how could it have been so bad

That she don't think it's not worth a fight, she won't try
But she'll be trying elsewhere

And she'll be loving elsewhere

And she'll keep secrets elsewhere

And I'll be somewhere thinking about her

And shell be willing elsewhere

And shell be giving elsewhere

And she'll have feelings elsewhere

But hope keeps saying kells you can make it
But in the meantime I can't sleep I can't think

There's so many things in my head

Things she said, things that she meant

Things that I started feeling the day that she left

Things that I slept on

Things that I should have accepted

Things I expected and the things I neglected

I better get up off my ass

Get first flight out, and get her back
Or else
She'll be living elsewhere

And she'll be crying elsewhere

And shell be feeling elsewhere

And I'll be somewhere thinking about her

She'll be smiling elsewhere

And she'll be laughing elsewhere

Giving all of my sweet love away elsewhere

That's the reason why I gotta catch that flight

? I'm out of time?
 


Baby, I'm so glad you're over here

Now I get to show you all the things

That I been wanting to show you for such a long time

Don't say nothin Picture this you and me in the kitchen babe, on the counter

Feeding each other fruits babe

Straight from there walk into the bedroom babe

I touch your hair and then you turn around and say what's on your mind

And girl tonight we'll be making sweet love
 

Girl tonight we'll make sweet love

Until the rain comes falling down on you and me

All of these things and etcetera etcetera etcetera

Wanna kiss you places you want me to

Promise girl that I'll do all of these things

I don't know how to make it stop, no
I got a phobia when it comes to heights

Even if it's a first class flight

And as a kid, I never really liked to climb

If you pushed me hard on a swing, then I'd cry
If I had a dream that I was flying,

Then I'd wake up in a panic, screaming
And now you take me up and away with you

Push me out of the plane with no parachute

And now I'm gonna need somebody to catch me

It's like I'm falling from the sky sky, sky

I'm falling from the sky sky, sky

It's like I'm falling form the sky sky, sky

And I need somebody to catch me
Catch me, when I come down down, down, down

When I come down down, down, down

When I come down down, down, down

Will you catch me?

When I come down down, down, down

When I come down
I never ever wanted to climb a ladder

And I never wanted a house in the hills

I'm comfortable living in a big high rise

Cause in nightmares of getting killed

I never wanted to swim, the water there was too deep

Put me up on the roof, you couldn't pay me to leave

Even if I was bummin on the streets

You couldn't pay me to leave
And now you take me up and away with you

Push me out of the plane with no parachute

And now I'm gonna need somebody to catch me

It's like I'm falling from the sky sky, sky

I'm falling from the sky sky, sky

It's like I'm falling form the sky sky, sky

And I need somebody to catch me
Catch me, when I come down down, down, down

When I come down down, down, down

When I come down down, down, down

Will you catch me?

When I come down down, down, down

When I come down
Girl I'm running out of time, come back around

Only a few seconds before I hit the ground

How do you expect me to fly when you are my wings?

Oh I can't breathe, no

Baby it's like I'm dreaming, got nothing to hold on to

I can't wake up girl, laying next to you

I can't think, I can't sleep, I can't eat
It's like I'm falling from the sky sky, sky

I'm falling from the sky sky, sky

It's like I'm falling form the sky sky, sky

And I need somebody to catch me

Catch me, when I come down down, down, down

When I come down down, down, down

When I come down down, down, down

Will you catch me?

When I come down down, down, down

When I come down
Girl it's like I'm falling from the sky sky, sky

Mansions, hill and acres

Women, drinks and caterers

I would toast until the break of dawn

Swimming pools and strippers

Conversation six figures

Never crossed my mind to call home.
 

There's a note on the bathroom mirror

Telling me that you've had enough.
It took you leaving me

For my blind eyes to see that you mean.
 

Far more
Than this planet to me

Than the air I breath

From here to overseas

Girl you're all I need

Than the mountains and trees

You mean more than the birds and the bees

Honey take it from me

You are all I need
Hanging out with friends

Never calling to check in

Neglecting you in every way

Taking the home front for granted

What was straight, is now slanted

And I don't know what to do about this letter.
 
It took you leaving me

For my blind eyes to see that you mean.
 

Far More
More than this planet to me

More than the air I breath

From here to overseas

Girl you're all I need

Than the mountains and trees

You mean more than the birds and the bees

Honey take it from me

You are all I need
 

Far more
Ever since you've been gone

I realize girl just what it is I had at home

Oh Baby, you mean far more

Than this planet to me

Than this air I breath

Nothing can compare to your love for me.

To your love for me

To your love for me

To your love for me

Gotham city for the ghetto ghetto

Gotham city for the ghetto ghetto
Uh yo yo! Everybody's talking

About the good old days

About the good old days

Huh I remember when me and my brothers

Summertime and just talk about just making it

You know what I'm saying being successful

Following up our dreams you know and I

I believe that's every kids dream

You know what I'm saying to rise and

Be somebody but damn!

Sometimes we just get caught up
I ain't got no money

And I ain't got no friends

Looks like my world is coming to an end

No food on the table, no clothes on my back

No shoes on my feet and

I just bearly got a used Cadillac

Now ain't that ghetto for ya

Why should I have to settle for less

When I could push the V-12's with finesse

scratching and all that mess

Would I keep on struggling till I hit the sky.

Even if you wanted to you can't deny

Gotta feed baby girl who would die
We keep talking about escalating

Well who's gonna go first

Guess I'll be the one to step up

If you don't follow me it would be the worst

Every time something goes down

Somebody's crying ghetto tears

Hope I'm not raining on your parade

But this is not what keeping it really is

Now ain't that ghetto for ya

But somehow it's gotta change yeah!

Ghetto for ya,

Ceiling fans with you on top of me

And the window blinds are filled with rays of sun

And all you secret fantasies thy will be done done

And inside of your walls there will dwell a Capricorn

If we keep this up then a love child will be born

All because

Of the greatest
 

The greatest you

The greatest me

We have found the greatest chemistry

The greatest touch

The greatest kiss

What came to be is the greatest wish

The greatest show

The greatest song

The greatest words

The greatest all night long

Baby your love stays constantly on my mind

This is the best sex I've ever had
I know twelve ways to make your love come down

And the secret places on you will be found

Like a voyage when the storm begins to roar

There's no telling what this night could have in store in store

Cause inside of your walls there will dwell a Capricorn

that will feast your body all night

And if we keep this up then a love child will be born

All because

Of the greatest
 
Something heaven has ordained for the sake of our love

Like a hand and glove we go together this love is forever oooh
This sex is so good I've got to break it down

But still I got my head up just like I promised you

Every since you left your baby, boy's been dealin with

Problem after problem, tell me what am I supposed to do

See, I get lost sometimes, don't understand this place

Look in the mirror sometimes and see a troubled face

And then my tears roll down and hit the sink

Then I hold my head up high, I hope the Man upstairs can hear my cry

All these questions deep inside my mind

Like if Jesus loved me, why he leave my side, mama

I'm still tryin to get the answer why

You were young, 45, and you had to die

Hit song or not, I've given all of me

You smile in my face and tell me that you love

But then before you know the truth, you're so quick to judge me

That's alright, go ahead, keep talkin 
Cause I'ma hold my head up high and keep walkin 
And reach for the sky, focus on the plan

Rescue the kid with his paper a pen

And this is for the homies that we lost

Yo  we cannot forget y'all, so the hats come off

We pour a little liquor out for the memory

I know y'all up there sittin on chrome in them pearly streets

The street survivors before careful, stay alive

Fo real tho And don't forget I kept you out of jail

Fo real tho Where's my arms when you needed to be held
They turn they backs on you, who was there believin 
Who said your troubles were only for a season

In church together tryin to pick up all the pieces

And now you betray me, I bind you in the name of Jesus

Somebody please pray what I'm talkin bout

And stop hurtin one another, fightin one another

Man, I pray to God He get my family back together

Let me see what want to see, just to blind me

All of these luxuries, wine and dining

And then You push me out in front to get behind me

Then You sat me up by blessin me to bind me

Gotta go to church now to avoid the fight

Frankly, y'all to keep it real I'm just tired

Have dreams of bein dead, but the devil is alive

Stuck between these two worlds

What I'm gonna do with both these girls

Hard to choose between her and these streets

Cause the game keeps calling me
 

Baby girl had me off my grind, off my clock

I would often find I was off my block

Couldn't keep her off my mind, my balls were shot

They never thought that a pause or stop
Was in my pores to push rock raw

Take a lost rebound like Bo Outlaw, I'm so outlaw

Got a hunger for this game, but keep that on the low

Like a one against the grain
Got the sun against my brain

A girl in my ear

I like her for her

I'm a dig into this shit, I like it like I like her
Sometimes I can't figure it out

I'm in love with the life but she's sticking it out

You made the sun

You made the moo

Gave seasons change

Woah

You made the clouds

You put the rainbow after rain

Woah

Created time

Now this ones mine

Gave pictures frames

Woah

Created man gave him woman

Why did you do that for me?
These are the questions asked before I lay me down and go to sleep

ooh sometimes I wonder

Sometimes I wonder why you decided to keep you hands on me

Of all the miracles, signs and wonders

There's still one mystery

How did you manage to love me?
You breathed the life right into me

Then made my heart beat

Woah

Created the mountains

And all of the deep seas

Flowers in the trees

Woah

You made tomorrow come again

You carved the strong winds

Woah

And after all I've done

Gave me a son

Tell me why would you do that for me?
These are the questions asked before I lay me down and go to sleep

Right in the middle of my prayers

Sometimes I wonder why you decided to keep you hands on me

Of all the miracles, signs and wonders

There's still one mystery

How did you manage to love me? how did you manage that?

How did you manage to love me?
 


How do I tell her that I'm gonna wait?

When I know that she'll be begging me to stay.

And how do I tell her, that the time has come to part?

When she's, she's gonna take it so hard.

I don't wanna break her heart,

I don't wanna see her cry!

Cause I promised her forever,

That I'll be by her side.
So, how do I tell her, tell her goodbye?

Oh yeah!
How do I tell her that my path is gonna change,

When I know that her heart won't be able to stand the pain?

And how do I tell her that I'm moving on with my life,

When she's just gonna break down and die?

Oh, I don't wanna break her heart, no!

I don't wanna break her heart,

I don't wanna see her cry!

When I promised a girl forever I'll be by her side?
So, how do I tell her, tell her goodbye?

Oh yeah!
Listen!

She's been forever faithful, hones and true,

Yes she was!

My god, this is gonna be the worst thing that I ever had to do!

How, how, how, how, how?

How do I tell her, oh, that the time has come to part,

When I know she's gonna take it so very bad?

Yes she is!

I don't wanna break her heart,

I don't wanna see her cry!

When I promised her forever,

That I'll be by her side.
How do I tell her, tell her, tell her goodbye?

Bye, bye, oh baby, bye!

How do I tell her, how do I tell her, goodbye babe?

I want somebody tell me,

I Believe lyrics By R. KELLY

BARACK OBAMA:

In small towns and big cities

We came together

As democrats, republicans, and independents

To stand up and say that we are

ONE NATION, we are ONE PEOPLE

And our time for changed has COME..
R. KELLY:

When the mountain seems too high

And you don't have the courage nor the strength to climb

And the road you're on won't end

But still you run though you cannot see the finish line
And dark clouds are over you

Your skies no longer blue

But you marched on straight ahead

Somehow you made it through
Got to the mountain peek

They left a path of me

Your victory made history and now
CHORUS:

I believe, I believe, I believe

Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe

Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe

Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe

Oh I
When it felt like you were weak

And couldn't fight no more

On the ropes and it seemed like

You was gonna run out of breathe
When the world was on your shoulder

And the walls were in your way

You leaped and made it over

Through it all you kept the faith
With hope you set us free

You showed us how to dream

And now we can lift our voices

And forever sing
Now the time to look ahead

And thank our heroes of the past

And celebrate this victory

Let's raise the flag cause
CHORUS:

I believe, I believe, I believe

Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe

Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe

Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe

Oh I
BRIDGE:

And when they tried to keep you down

You kept up your head

Never losing sight

You believed in what was right
You endured to the end

Walked through the strongest wind

The storms over

And a new day begins
And when our hope was dying

You brought us healing

And now I got something

To tell my children
CHORUS:

I believe, I believe, I believe

Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe

Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe

Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe

Oh I
 


I used to think that I could not go on

And life was nothing but an awful song

But now I know the meaning of true love

I'm leaning on the everlasting arms
If I can see it, then I can do it

If I just believe it, there's nothing to it
I believe I can fly

I believe I can touch the sky

I think about it every night and day Night and day

Spread my wings and fly away

I believe I can soar

I see me running through that open door

I believe I can fly

I believe I can fly

I believe I can fly hoo

Though I must admit that things got out of hand

When you told me that he was just a friend

I should of had my trust in you from the very start darlin 
Cause I never meant for this to end

How can we get it back again?

Oh sometimes a man can say things that he really don't mean

Well I'm sorry baby- bring your lovin back to me
 
Baby we can meet somewhere and talk about it

Oh baby, can we work it out

I'm not gonna let you go my baby before I let you know that I
 
 


Girl I must have been crazy to say that it was over

I had to be a fool to yell out we were through

And now I'm all lonely and feeling down and out baby

When I never meant for this to end, it was so so crazy of me

Sometimes we say things that were really don't mean

Well I'm sorry baby, bring your lovin back to me
 

I can't sleep babe, I can't think babe, I can't live babe

Without you in my life I can't go on baby

This is my song baby

Don't wanna do nothin if I go away baby

And I can't do nothin if you're not around

I decided to stay home tonight

I decided I'ma treat you right

I decided to be there for you

Decided to be on my P's and Q's

I decided to give up my friends

Decided I'ma take you out weekends

Decided to give you a reason to trust

These are decisions that I make for love
Enough is enough no more running around

Searchin for what's right here at home

Because my luck is bout to turn around

And I just can't keep doin you wrong

Girl I take it for granted that you will be here always

Tired of this ego trip

Cause soon you'll be searchin for another man

And I just can't have that happen to me
 
Now I've had about all that I can stand no more

I'm turnin in my playa's card

See I'm retirin from the secret life I chose

Cause I just can't keep breakin your heart

It was silly of me to be the way that I was

First was blind, but now I see

Baby, soon you'll be sayin I'm fallin out of love

And I just can't let it happen whoa whoa I
 
 

When tha morning comes, you see the sun will shine on you and me

Was on my way to losin you, until I found reality

So cast away your doubts and fears, cause from now on I'll be right here

For always

Forever more, I decided
 
 
Girl I'm going to dump my friends

Yes I will

Truly I will

We are going to be together on the weekend

Whoa, whoa

See these are the decisions I made for love

For the two of us

Get up off this bull and rebuild your trust

Yeah, yeah, oh no, whoa

There will be

No more cheatin 
No more creepin 
No more fuckin 
No more sneakin

If you wanna lead, be a leader

If you wanna dream, be a dreamer

Climb to the top of that mountain and scream it

But remember when you get to the top

Everything you say is gonna matter

Everything you do is gonna add up

It's what you asked for, so

Don't get mad when it's not what you thought

Careful now, girl, with them Jezebel ways

Crown on your head, but you're queen of cliches

Little one playin with the big boys now

Hope you're ready when it comes back around
I had a dream that we were born

A generation to behold

Writing fires with our words

Instead of useless smoke that blurs

The lines are writing oh

Expression that they're told

An army with a sword

That lingers when we're gone

I had a dream
If you wanna preach be a preacher

If you wanna teach be a teacher

Remember that the footprints you're leaving, will

Tell us all who you really are

It's too bad you can't see what you're worth

Spreadin your legs stead of usin your words

Character is shown by the things that we do

The one thing you're never gonna hide is the truth

Cause anyone can tell when you're sellin out

And anyone can fly when they're fallin down
I had a dream that we were born

A generation to behold

Writing fires with our words

Instead of useless smoke that blurs

The lines are writing oh

Expression that they're told

An army with a sword

That lingers when we're gone

I had a dream
I had a dream

I had a dream that we were born I had a dream that we were born

A generation to behold to behold

Writing fires with our words writing fires with our words

Instead of useless smoke that blurs

The lines are writing oh

Expression that they're told they're told

An army with a sword

That lingers when we're gone when we're gone

I had a dream I had a dream
I had a dream

I had a dream

As I lay me down

Heaven hear me now

I'm lost without a cause

After giving it my all
Winter storms have come

And darkened my sun

After all that I've been through

Who on earth can I turn to
I look to you

I look to you
After all my strength is gone

In you I can be strong
I look to you

I look to you
Yeah
And when melodies are gone

In you I hear a song
I look to you, you
About to lose my breathe,

There's no more fighting left,

I'm sinking to rise no more,

Searching for that open door, door
Every road that I've taken

Lead to my regret.

I don't know if I'm going to make it.

Nothing to do but lift my head
I look to you.

I look to you.

After all my strength is gone,

In you I can be strong

I look to you.

I look to you.

And when melodies are gone,

In you I hear a song.

I look to you Whitney

We love you Whitney, rest in peace

About the way things went down

Especially since we been dealin 
For like seven years now

I've been slowly, slowly bringing you down

No conversation, no good sex in a while

But still you search and find a way

To love me somehow

Even though I ride, you still trust me somehow

Got my faces, some ice and a tie

Slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly goin down
I don't mean it When I hollar at you

Running around here talking about

How I'm a big player now

Hidden in corners, blinging out our share

Kelly makin hits now

Thinking about this industry

And how I put it out

You were there for me

When I used dish rags for ties

There's times that I didn't hear you

Whenever we fight I try to win every round

Can you find a way to forgive me now

I wish, I wish, I wish

To every city

I wish, I wish, I wish

Every hood

I wish, I wish, I wish

And every block

Ghetto America!
Rollin through the hood

Just stopped by to say what's up

And let you know

Your baby boy ain't doing so tough

And even though you passed

Going on four long years

Still waking up late at night crying tears

Just thinking about those days

You used to talk to me

Smilin while I'm sippin on this Hennessey

And remember we bragged on how rich we would be

To get up out this hood was like a fantasy
And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin 
Oh I can't believe my ears

And what everybody's sayin 
And boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half

I would give it all up, just to take one ride
With you

How I used to kick it on the front porch

With you

And how I used to lay back and smoke weed

With you

And all the little basement party joints we'd do

Now I'm just missing you

How I wish
I wish that I could hold you now

I wish that I could touch you now

I wish that I could talk to you

Be with you somehow

I know you're in a better place

Even though I can't see your face

I know you're smiling down on me

Saying everything's okay

And if I make it out this thug life

I'll see you again someday

I wish, I wish, I wish

I wish, I wish, I wish
Now ever since this money come

It's been nothing but stress

Sometimes I wish that I could just trade in my success

Y'all look at me and say boy you've been blessed

But y'all don't see the inside of my unhappiness

Man I swear this shit gets heavy like a ton

That's why you hear me shootin  this real shit off like a gun

Hmm I wonder how my friends would treat me now

If I wasn't iced up with a Bentley and a house

That's why fake ass niggas get fake ass digits

And fake ass playas get a real playa hatin em

Honey Love goes platinum and y'all ass come around

But y'all don't want to raise the roof

Until my shit is going down
And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin 
Oh I can't believe my ears

And what everybody's sayin 
Boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half

I would give it all up, just to take one ride
With you

How I used to hoop off in them tournaments

With you

And how I used to club hop on weekends

With you

Your family called the morning of the tragic end

Damn, my condolences
I wish that I could hold you now

I wish that I could touch you now

I wish that I could talk to you

Be with you somehow

I know you're in a better place

Even though I can't see your face

I know you're smiling down on me

Saying everything's okay

And if I make it out this thug life

I'll see you again someday

I wish, I wish, I wish

I wish, I wish, I wish
Voices in my head be telling me to come to church

Said the Lord is the only way for you to stop the hurt

Dreaming of windows black tinted like a hearse

When waking up to life sometimes seems worst

And all I ever wanted is to be a better man

And I try to keep it real with my homies now

For me to save the world I don't understand

How did I become the leader of a billion men?
And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin 
Oh I can't believe my ears

And what everybody's sayin 
Boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half

I would give it all up, just to take one ride
With you

How I used to street perform on Friday

With you

And how I used to go to church on Easter Sunday

With you

Standing here throwing them songs at me

Somebody pray for me
I wish that I could hold you now

I wish that I could touch you now

I wish that I could talk to you

Be with you somehow

I know you're in a better place

Even though I can't see your face

I know you're smiling down on me

Saying everything's okay
I wish that I could hold you now

I wish that I could touch you now

I wish that I could talk to you

Be with you somehow

I know you're in a better place

Even though I can't see your face

I know you're smiling down on me

Saying everything's okay
I wish that I could hold you now

I wish that I could touch you now

I wish that I could talk to you

Be with you somehow

I know you're in a better place

Even though I can't see your face

I know you're smiling down on me

Saying everything's okay
 


I wish, I wish, I wish

To every city

I wish, I wish, I wish

Every hood

I wish, I wish, I wish

And every block

Ghetto America!
Rollin through the hood

Just stopped by to say what's up

And let you know

Your baby boy ain't doing so tough

And even though you passed

Going on four long years

Still waking up late at night crying tears

Just thinking about those days

You used to talk to me

Smilin while I'm sippin on this Hennessey

And remember we bragged on how rich we would be

To get up out this hood was like a fantasy
And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin 
Oh I can't believe my ears

And what everybody's sayin 
And boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half

I would give it all up, just to take one ride
With you

How I used to kick it on the front porch

With you

And how I used to lay back and smoke weed

With you

And all the little basement party joints we'd do

Now I'm just missing you

How I wish
I wish that I could hold you now

I wish that I could touch you now

I wish that I could talk to you

Be with you somehow

I know you're in a better place

Even though I can't see your face

I know you're smiling down on me

Saying everything's okay

And if I make it out this thug life

I'll see you again someday

I wish, I wish, I wish

I wish, I wish, I wish
Now ever since this money come

It's been nothing but stress

Sometimes I wish that I could just trade in my success

Y'all look at me and say boy you've been blessed

But y'all don't see the inside of my unhappiness

Man I swear this shit gets heavy like a ton

That's why you hear me shootin  this real shit off like a gun

Hmm I wonder how my friends would treat me now

If I wasn't iced up with a Bentley and a house

That's why fake ass niggas get fake ass digits

And fake ass playas get a real playa hatin em

Honey Love goes platinum and y'all ass come around

But y'all don't want to raise the roof

Until my shit is going down
And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin 
Oh I can't believe my ears

And what everybody's sayin 
Boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half

I would give it all up, just to take one ride
With you

How I used to hoop off in them tournaments

With you

And how I used to club hop on weekends

With you

Your family called the morning of the tragic end

Damn, my condolences
I wish that I could hold you now

I wish that I could touch you now

I wish that I could talk to you

Be with you somehow

I know you're in a better place

Even though I can't see your face

I know you're smiling down on me

Saying everything's okay

And if I make it out this thug life

I'll see you again someday

I wish, I wish, I wish

I wish, I wish, I wish
Voices in my head be telling me to come to church

Said the Lord is the only way for you to stop the hurt

Dreaming of windows black tinted like a hearse

When waking up to life sometimes seems worst

And all I ever wanted is to be a better man

And I try to keep it real with my homies now

For me to save the world I don't understand

How did I become the leader of a billion men?
And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin 
Oh I can't believe my ears

And what everybody's sayin 
Boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half

I would give it all up, just to take one ride
With you

How I used to street perform on Friday

With you

And how I used to go to church on Easter Sunday

With you

Standing here throwing them songs at me

Somebody pray for me
I wish that I could hold you now

I wish that I could touch you now

I wish that I could talk to you

Be with you somehow

I know you're in a better place

Even though I can't see your face

I know you're smiling down on me

Saying everything's okay
I wish that I could hold you now

I wish that I could touch you now

I wish that I could talk to you

Be with you somehow

I know you're in a better place

Even though I can't see your face

I know you're smiling down on me

Saying everything's okay
I wish that I could hold you now

I wish that I could touch you now

I wish that I could talk to you

Be with you somehow

I know you're in a better place

Even though I can't see your face

I know you're smiling down on me

Saying everything's okay
 


 

No mountain's too high for you to climb

All you have to do is have some climbing faith

No river's too wide for you to make it across

All you have to do is believe it when you pray
 

And then you will see the morning will come

and everyday will be bright as the sun

All of your fears cast them on me

I just want you to see
 

I'll be your cloud up in the sky

I'll be your shoulder when you cry

I hear your voices when you call me

I am your Angel,

And when all hope is gone, I'm here

No matter how far you are, I'm near

It makes no difference who you are

I am your Angel, I'm your Angel
 

I saw your tear drops and I heard you cry

All you need is time, seek me and you shall find

You have everything and you're still lonely

It don't have to be this way

Let me show you a better day
 

And then you will see, the morning will come

And all of your days will be bright as the sun

So all of your fears just cast them on me

How can I make you see
 
 

And when it's time to face the storm
 

I'll be right by your side
 

Grace will keep us safe and warm

And I know we will survive
 

And when it seems as if your end is drawing near end is drawing near

Don't you dare give up the fight

Just put your trust beyond the skies
 
 


I mean everybody say "What if." What if I could fly?

What if man could fly for real? Wouldn't that be something?

Man I would surely touch the sky if I could just fly

You know we have our dreams, we always say what if

What if you and me were together? What if?

Forever, I mean eternity for real

What if?

How did I ever let you slip away

Never knowing I'd be singing this song some day

And now I'm sinking, sinking to rise no more

Ever since you closed the door
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time

Then my darlin you'd still be mine

If I could turn, turn back the hands of time

Then darlin you, you'd still be mine
Funny, funny how time goes by

And blessings are missed in the wink of an eye

Why oh why oh why should one have to go on suffering

When every day I pray please come back to me
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time

Then my darlin you'd still be mine

If I could turn, turn back the hands of time

Then darlin you, you'd still be mine
And you had enough love for the both of us

But I, I, I did you wrong, I admit I did

But now I'm facing the rest of my life alone, whoa
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time

Then my darlin you'd still be mine

If I could turn, turn back the hands of time

Then darlin you, you'd still be mine
I'd never hurt you If I could turn back

Never do you wrong If I could turn back

And never leave your side If I could turn back

If I could turn back the hands
There'd be nothing I wouldn't do for you

If I could turn back

Forever honest and true to you

If I could turn back

If you accept me back in your heart, I love you

If I could turn back the hands
If I could turn back

That would be my will

If I could turn back

Darlin I'm begging you to take me by the hands

If I could turn back the hands
I'm going down, yes I am

If I could turn back

Down on my bended knee, yeah

If I could turn back

And I'm gonna be right there until you return to me

If I could turn back the hands
If I could turn back

If I could just turn back that little clock on the wall

If I could turn back

Then I'd come to realize how much I love you

Love you love you love you

If I could turn back the hands
 


I don't understand

I do all this for you

You contemplating on me

Or is it him

Or is it me

Or is it him

He told you he'd be there for you

And he wasn't

I told you I'd be there for you

And I was

And still is the real is

Who takes care of biz

Took you from apartments

And got you home like The Wiz

I'm not the kind of guy

To give you everything

But if you're real then

You can get some ice in your rings

You and me straight to the crib

Off the tour bus

Spottin my eyes, fireplace, big as us

It really don't matter

Who's first in the shower

Fruit platter from a young maid every hour

And when it comes down to the dollar

You can have it

All ya gotta do is keep it hoppin like a rabbit

Friends come around don't be ready to change

Treat me like a stepchild when I'm up on my game

Remember I'm the first to give your cootie the pain

So I wanna hear you answer when I ask you my name
Ooh baby, I want you here with me

And give you everything

That your heart desires

Lady can you feel me

Do you wanna be with me for always

Baby can't you see

What you do to me

when he do the things that he has done to you baby
 

You don't need nobody to love you

You don't need nobody to kiss you

You don't need nobody to please you, ooh babe

Cause I can do those things if I'm wit you, baby
Now who took you in when that nigga put you out

And who picked you up when that nigga put you down

Restraining orders keep that fool from around

Had to set you up in a spot downtown

See I was the one who was there for you

But I'm not the one that's gonna play the two

Channel bags in the trunk what you gon do

You could treat the future like a menu

As long as I'm the only one to bend you

And when you wanna take a flight I'm the one to send you

Never be the one that's out to hurt you

Tell you that I'm there and then desert you
 
Baby, can't you see

What you do to me

When he do the things he do to you, baby

Shut up,

I don't never want to hear you say that again

Baby I'm not going nowhere

Look at me, you understand me?
Now, what gave you the silly idea that I'm about to leave

Girl who you been listening to? They must be crazy

Look back and see our past and all the shit that we been through

I'll be damned if I'm gon let this bullcrap take me away from you

Cause I vow to give my all and girl I'm a man of my words

And on that word, I'll stand tall

Being without you sounds absurd

So dry your weeping eyes

Cause I'll be here by your side

No need to doubt the sky

I'm in this for the long ride
 

I will never leave, no

You don't have to worry

Girl I will be right there for you

I will never leave, no

Baby can't you see

I was born to be with you

I will never leave, no

God put us together

Nothing can take that away

I will never leave you no

Now until forever, be with you the rest of my days
You never have to question the love I have for you

Girl I will put my life on bended knees for you

Ask all my friends, they'll tell you

Your all I talk about

Even when I go to sleep your the only one I dream about

See I'm your picture girl and baby you are my frame

And that's why I know our love will stay the same

So dry your weeping eyes

Girl I'm by your side

Just trust me I'm that guy

I'm in it for the long ride
 
Since that the day the doctor took me out of the womb and spanked me

Girl I was born to be with you and the rest is history

Generations and now I'm all grown up and you carry my seed

Now we are flesh and blood

With you I am in love

For the rest of my life

For the rest of my life

We've been blessed with a love that's rare

That's why I'm not going nowhere
 
I was meant to be with you

Want you to let em all know that I wish them well

No mountain's too high for you to climb

All you have to do is have some climbing faith

No river's too wide for you to make it across

All you have to do is believe it when you pray
 

And then you will see the morning will come

and everyday will be bright as the sun

All of your fears cast them on me

I just want you to see
 

I'll be your cloud up in the sky

I'll be your shoulder when you cry

And then you will see, the morning will come

And all of your days will be bright as the sun

So all of your fears just cast them on me

How can I make you see
 
 

And when it's time to face the storm
 

I'll be right by your side
 

Grace will keep us safe and warm

And I know we will survive
 

And when it seems as if your end is drawing near end is drawing near

Don't you dare give up the fight

Just put your trust beyond the skies

Well

Are you ready for me?

Before I start, I just wanna get a few things off my chest.

Take ya time brother

You see, being in the business that I am in, looks like everything I do,

Everywhere I go, and everything I see,

Seems to be through some kind of magnifying glass-yes- Can I talk about it?

Talk on,talk on

While you're looking I suggest you take a good look 
And I hope you find just what it is you're looking for

Amen
Just like that song says- ain't nobody's business what I do

Now can I move on?

Move on, move on, move on brother Kelly

I remember when I was trying to be somebody, but I just didn't know nobody

I didn't know nobody

But now

Now

I said now

Now

Can I say it again?

Gon and say it again

Now, every since God has blessed me, it seems that things are going a little

Bit differentyes it is
Folks ain't it funny how things can say sometimes,why,even the Statue of

Liberty want some bump and grind

Can I getta witness off up in them jeeps Amen

I don't see nothing wrong with a little truth

Now-now, wait a minute, go that way

Ya see the good book says that the truth is the light,please, I think it's time

To turn on your lights and see the truth

Can, Can I talk on?

You don't know where I've been, you don't know where I'm going, You don't know

What I do.
Can I get a witness?

So before you go trying to pass judgment on me, pass judgment on yourself,

Worry bout yourself, and what yourself is doing, and where yourself is going,

And who yourself has been with

That way, you

you

You

You

You , You don't have to ever worry about nobody

But Jesus
 


Man, they go and tell me like

You never know who your true friends until you ah umm

Both got a little bit of money

I mean cause why'all both broke

Then there's no strain on the relationship, why'all both broke

And if you got money and he ain't got no paper

He still needs you so you'll never know how he really feel about you

When you'll both get some paper, you'll see
We used to get money together, phone honies together

Pushin chromed out twinkies in custom coach leather

You claim it's all love, but nigga it's whatever

Cause this is business, it ain't personal

Same dream, same team, same schemes mm

We even sold to the same damn fiends how real is dat?

Ain't no rules in this war for this green

This is business, and it ain't personal
Look, I'm a grown man dog

And I ain't got time to be runnin behind y'all

I know when I first started it was crazy to y'all

"He's gon start his own label, he'll never be able"

Well, nigga you've been wrong before

And you'll be wrong again if you bet against him

We move through the hood like identical twins

But it just so happen that a nigga made it rappin 
You showed your true colors, y'all niggaz stay yappin 
That don't stop him, a nigga weigh platinum

Stop through the hood, to say what's happenin  sup nigga

Fake hugz uh-huh fake whassup

Fake love, fake fuck, fake thugs

Gotta one myself for your fake shit, I raise up

Hop in my wheels and I peel, streets are blazed up uh-huh

About my bid'ness dog, y'all need to stay up - one
 

We used to get money together, phone honeys together

Pushin chromed out twinkies in custom coach leather

You claim it's all love, but nigga it's whatever

Cause this is business, it ain't personal

Same dream, same team, same schemes

We even sold to the same damn fiends

Ain't no rules in this war for this green

This is business, and it ain't personal
I wish, I wish, that success, we could all

Get a piece of it word but that ain't real dog no

Cause in these streets it's war, the industry much more

But rich or poor, I'ma keep it real my nigga

Invest in chips and watch my money hill get bigger

And do things like, pull up to some clubs

In the skirts with Jigga, and yellin out HEY!

What the fuck, pop that Cris my nigga

And then he wants to know how many chips I done sold

Well it ain't y'all business what's behind my doors

But y'all niggaz don't appreciate shit

Helped you out and you still actin like a little bitch

Then you wonder why I put yo ass in the tenth row

When you asked me for some tickets to my TP-2 show

Lawwwwwwd tell me, why we don't like to see us grow
 
A-Alike uh-huh be alike that's right

We don't vibe no more because we don't C/see alike

And your mom got it twisted, she think Hov changed

Nope; Hov's still here like Rogaine

Ask your boy what he did to the Hov game

How he jeopardized the whole game

Now when we see each other it's so strange

I don't know whether to hug him or slug him damn

I don't know whether to cap him or dap him

I don't know what to think of him, I don't know what's happenin 
But what I do know, all the niggaz that you know

Locked up doin a few doe, but who knows?

Maybe it wasn't you, maybe I'm buggin too right

But I'm scared dog, I don't know what the fuck to do

Do me a favor, place yourself in my shoes

The game, no exceptions, gotta follow the rules

Keep me from rocking the white gold

While you at home burning the hot coal

Honey left you coming home to me like it's a curfew

One nice day and now she calling me boo

And she calling you through
And you calling me singing the sad tune

I wish Kelly would pick up the celly

Got a Philly in a telly with cramps in her belly

Now I can get freaky with some K-why-jelly
But I'd rather go cruise with my man

What the deally?

Day One

Dear Nuala,

Thank you very much for your lovely present of a partridge in a pear-tree

We're getting the hang of feeding the partridge now,

Although it was difficult at first to win its confidence

It bit the mother rather badly on the hand

But they're good friends now and we're keeping the pear-tree indoors in a bucket

Thank you again

Yours affectionately, Gobnait O'LÃºnasa
Day Two

Dear Nuala,

I cannot tell you how surprised we were to hear from you so soon again and to receive your lovely present of two turtle doves

You really are too kind

At first the partridge was very jealous

And suspicious of the doves and they had a terrible row the night the doves arrived

We had to send for the vet but the birds are okay again

And the stitches are due to some out in a week or two

The vet's bill was 8 but the mother is over her annoyance now

And the doves and the partridge are watching the telly from the pear-tree as I write Yours ever, Gobnait
Day Three

Dear Nuala,

We must be foremost in your thoughts

I had only posted my letter when the three French hens arrived

There was another sort-out between the hens and the doves,

Who sided with the partridge, and the vet had to be sent for again

The mother was raging because the bill was 16 this time

But she has almost cooled down

However, the fact that the birds droppings keep falling down

On her hair whilen she's watching the telly, doesn't help matters

Thanking you for your kindness

I remain, your Gobnait
Day Four

Dear Nuala,

You mustn't have received my last letter when you were sending us the four calling birds There was pandemonium in the pear-tree again last night and the vet's bill was 32

The mother is on sedation as I write

I know you meant no harm and remain your close friend

Gobnauit
Day Five

Nuala,

Your generosity knows no bounds

Five gold rings! When the parcel arrived I was scared stiff that it might be more birds, because the smell in the living-room is atrocious

However, I don't want to seem ungrateful for the beautiful rings

Your affectionate friend, Gobnait
Day Six

Nuala,

What are you trying to do to us? It isn't that we don't appreciate your generosity

But the six geese have not alone nearly murdered the calling birds

But they laid their eggs on top of the vet's head

From the pear-tree and his bill was 68 in cash !

My mother is munching 60 grains of Valium a day

And talking to herself in a most alarming way

You must keep your feelings for me in check

Gobnait
Day Seven

Nuala,

We are not amused by your little joke

Seven swans-a-swimming is a most romantic idea but not in the bath of a private house

We cannot use the bathroom now because they've gone completely savage

And rush the door every time we try to enter

If things go on this way, the mother and I will smell as bad as the living-room carpet Please lay off It is not fair

Gobnait
Day Eight

Nuala,

Who the hell do you think gave you the right to send eight,

Hefty maids-a-milking here, to eat us out of house and home?

Their cattle are all over the front lawn

And have trampled the hell out of the mother's rose-beds

The swans invaded the living-room in a sneak attack

And the ensuing battle between them and the calling birds,

Turtle doves, French hens and partridge make the battle

Of the Somme seem like Wanderly Wagon

The mother is on a bottle of whiskey a day, as well as the sixty grains of Valium

I'm very annoyed with you

Gobnait
Day Nine

Listen you looser!

There's enough pandemonium in this place night and day without nine drummers drumming, while the eight flaming maids-a-milking are beating my poor, old alcoholic mother out of her own kitchen and gobbling everything in sight

I'm warning you, you're making an enemy of me

Gobnait
Day Ten

Listen manure-face,

I hope you'll be haunted by the strains of ten pipers piping

Which you sent to torment us last night

They were aided in their evil work by those maniac drummers

And it wasn't a pleasant sight to look out the window

And see eight hefty maids-a-milking pogo-ing around with the ensuing punk-rock uproar

My mother has just finished her third bottle of whiskey,

On top of a hundred and twenty four grains of Valium

You'll get yours!

Gobnait O'LÃºnasa
Day Eleven

You have scandalized my mother, you dirty Jezebel,

It was bad enough to have eight maids-a-milking dancing to punk music on the front lawn but they've now been joined by your friends the eleven Lords-a-leaping

And the antics of the whole lot of them would leave

The most decadent days of the Roman Empire looking like Outlook

I'll get you yet, you loud bag!
Day Twelve

Listen slurry head,

You have ruined our lives

The twelve maidens dancing turned up last night

And beat the living daylights out of the eight maids-a-milking,

Cause they found them carrying on with the eleven Lords-a-leaping

Meanwhile, the swans got out of the living-room,

Where they'd been hiding since the big battle,

And savaged hell out of the Lords and all the Maids

There were eight ambulances here last night, and the local Civil Defence as well

The mother is in a home for the bewildered

And I'm sitting here, up to my neck in birds droppings, empty whiskey

And Valium bottles, birds blood and feathers,

While the flaming cows eat the leaves off the pear-tree

I'm a broken man

I was on my way

To getting close to you

Until you flipped the script on me

Another personality

I was just that close

To putting karats in your ring

Until I peeped your card

Now you threw it before you started baby
I was just a touch away

From playing the fool for you

Till you lost my trust

And now I got to back this thing on up

I was just a touch away

From playing the fool for you

Till you lost my trust

And now I got to back this thing on up, babe
You were almost in

About to take you home with me

Until you opened up my eyes

And showed me your other side

You were inches from the room

Just about to take control

Now that I know it was all an act

I got's to get that bracelet back
I was just a touch away

From playing the fool for you

Till you lost my trust

And now I got to back this thing on up

I was just a touch away

From playing the fool for you

Till you lost my trust

And now I got to back this thing on up, babe
What made you think you could lie to me?

Baby and get away with it

Come back down to reality

When it comes to love you just don't get it
I was just a touch away

From playing the fool for you

Till you lost my trust

And now I got to back this thing on up

I was just a touch away

From playing the fool for you

Till you lost my trust

And now I got to back this thing on up, babe
Having never lived like a lap full of g's

When all the time you was just tryna trap me

Closer, and closer, and closer to me

Trying to get rooted like the ground and trees

Now I want to get tight like the harmonies

All you want to do is just scheme, scheme, scheme

Riding in my gators sittin on my things

Drinking and smoking up all my weed
I was just a touch away

From playing the fool for you

Till you lost my trust

And now I got to back this thing on up

I was just a touch away

From playing the fool for you

Till you lost my trust

And now I got to back this thing on up, babe

Yo R. Kelly

What you going to do with this mix, man

Yo man

I'm just going to keep it street
Yo R. Kelly

It's time to give the homies

Something to dance to

You know what I'm saying

Push up on one of those cute hotties

Yo, this is what we are going to do

I'm going to take this track

Whip us up one of those nice gorilla beats

Yeah, something like that

I'm going to tell you the real true story

About back in the day

When I was trying to get where I am

Right now

Whip us up a nice intro
It's 1990 and the R is on the scene

Yeah filling up a funky beat

Strictly for the streets

You know what I mean

It took some time

But here I am with a swing

Yo R. Kelly

Tell them what they told you

All we really need

Is a funky groove

With a street swing

With a little street swing

Something you can get with

Bam, here it is

Keepin it street
 

Let's keep it street

Let's keep it street

Let's keep it street

Let's keep it street

Yo bring that beat back
Yo back in the days

The girlies turned me down like collars

Yeah but now they're popping like

"Orville Redenbacher"
And now they wanna holler

That's when I decided to whip up a funky track

I took it door to door

And this is what they said

All we really need from you

Is a funky groove

With a street swing

With a little street swing

Something you can get with

Bam here it is

Keeping it street
 
All we really need

Is a funky, funky groove

With a street swing

With a little street swing

Something you can get into

Bam here it is

Keeping is street
 
 


 

I've been kicking it with your girlfriend

Oh what am I gonna do?

Cause God knows that I really didn't mean to hurt you

I know it's bogus, but I felt that you should know the truth

I fell in love with her the moment that we were introduced

And I just feel that it's time for this little secret to end

Baby, I've been kicking it with your girlfriend
Go ahead and slap me again, cause I can understand how you feel

When a man takes you for granted and he don't keep it real

I should've been a man and told you a long time ago

Instead of stunning I should have broke it down and let you know

Girl my fault for that, don't know what's on my mind

And I blame myself for wasting your time

Believe, I really did try to keep that girl away from me

But her body language kept on temping and teasing me

And plus she knew what she was doing when she did it anyway

I knew what she was doing too and that made it okay

Truth is that we don't even regret it

Up out the closet I will be the first to say it
 
Now I apologize for me and her and everything that went down

These are the reasons why some girls don't bring they friends around

I just didn't know how to tell you that I was feelin her

And how we get away sometimes and make love

I never wanted to dislead you

At first I just wanted to please you

I know it's hard for you to be able to trust again

Because I came between you and your best friend

I did not ask for this

It just happened outta no where since the day we kissed

And the truth is that we don't even regret it

Up out the closet, I will be the first to say it
 
 

I'm sorry again

Never meant to hurt you

I'm sorry again

But girl I love her

I'm sorry again

I never meant to make you cry, no

The first one out the closet

You have reached R.Kelly

Unfortunately, I'm sleep

Been out partying all night

And I'm blasted off that Hennessey

I hop to hotel lobbies

Going to them after parties

Throwing up and carrying on

Bout to have somebody drive me home

I get through the door

Fall on the floor

Get up

I'm staggering

Look upstairs

Shit is blurry because I'm real bent

And now I don't know whether I'm coming or going

And this goes out to all of my honeys that's calling
Leave your name right after the beep and I'm

Sure to get back with you

If I'm not asleep or

Yeah, where my phone at? Call up Tar I need some xannies

I want these poor niggas to complain

I want these fake robbers to keep laying

And he ain't want these fake bitches to keep singing

They think baby is mine like they gon get a dime

We'll work it out with time

I want yours cause you got mine

Yeah-yeah-yeah, it ain't nothing to talk about

So I'm like what's there to kill about

When these bitches and niggas, they won't understand
As I revisit what I made for you to listen to

I get into my zone and let go, that's the ritual

Ask but when I mention you, not having clues and being fool

Darling to this one trick pony, thought I'm not the dude

And you can be a local heathen to the son of Satan

I give it up to him who praises and that's all I'm saying

I made a killing for a better life

Remember once and I'll forget it twice

Took advantage over night

I pray to God and hope I'm moving right

I pray on y'all to quench my appetite

Told you that my screws ain't tight

I had to buckle down and focus cause I almost lost it

I was hemorrhaging in the red and I could not afford it

Niggas tried to appropriate me, I could not go for it

I'm talking mine, I'm claiming mine, bitch I go Narcos for it

They gon make me glow up, I got no choice I'm saying

But what's the point of saying if you still won't understand?
 


That nigga let his fuckin flow go

Niggaz tryin to switch up the flows on niggaz

Hit niggaz, slip niggaz with a micky

Drop that joint

Peanut-butter interior, black body

And in case you didn't know, I be the Twista

Hundred bombs in my pockets, put your ones up

I hear some niggaz lookin at me for the come up

Can't nobody spit it fast as me

Got an academy of haters comin after me

I know I got what you want, I know I got what you need

Come and mob to the top before you get, this, money
Pull up on the block in the alien gray Bentley

Full of sport modes, you never could hang with me

Just to get in early, I paid a extra 50

Gettin that money my nigga

Oh-five Chrysler, trees for the blunts

Three hoes in the back, two fiends in the front

Twenty-two inch shoes, CV's in the trunk

Glad to be down with these two livin legends

Now let me see which league I'ma invest in

Gettin that money my nigga

Have her man like who's, he

Was a pimp at birth, first ho was a nurse

And I'ma be a pimp til I'm stretches in a hearse

Sometimes showbiz is the worst

Gettin this money switchin my whips and my kicks

To be a, lame with visions of riches, enter my brain

Like I picture myself in deep dishes, just switchin lanes

It's just insane, is it? I'm from the district where niggaz

So we fend for ourself, and the wealth is in raw

We can't help but been lost, what else gon make that engine roar?

Into the club we get all the eyes when you gettin that money my nigga

Yo, for those who live the way that I live

We came a long way

From wiping coal outta eyelids, to rap's hottest

Fake Gazelles to black Pradas

Selling nicks to trey bags, to making hits like Kidada Jones father

OG's would send me to the store with a dollar

Hit me with some wise advice for me to follow

Ain't nothing free in the world in life

No matter who you are, everybody got they price

And some cost more than other's

When you poor, it's like life ain't even worth living

But when you rich, it's every fat ass worth hittin 
With no chips, your drawers just stay on your hips

I play with the six cuz money make the whole world spin

But without the Franklin faces, you see who's your real friends

It's V-12's, honeys on the cell, bobbin out the JBL

It's Nas and R. Kell
 

Never thought that I'd ever live this life

Money stacked in rolls, honeys on each side

Anything I want, I can say it's mine

No more worries bout how can I provide
Money makes the world go round

Nothin move but the money

You believe it if you want to

Money makes the world go round

Said nothin move but the money
 

Oh, many say it's wrong cause I love to spend

Ice in everything countin Benjamins

All I wanna do try, and let you know

If you don't believe, ask someone who's broke
Money makes the world go round

Money makes the world go round

You believe it if you want to

Money makes the world go round

Yes it does

Still nuttin move but the money

Said money makes the world go round

Money make the world go round, what?

Still nuttin move but the money

Nothing but the money

Money makes the world go round

Yes it does
Feels so good, yeah, yeah

So good, this life I finally live

And feels so real

So real this freedom I finally feel

Show me the money
Money makes the world go round

Go money, go money

You believe it if you want to

Money makes the world go round

Go money, go money, yo

Said that almighty dollar

Money makes the world go round

Yeah, what?

So much money
Money makes the world go round

Hey, makes the world go round

Money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round

Show me a man that don't need money

Money makes the world go around

And I'll show you a world

Show me a world

Standing still, oh

Yes it does, talking bout the loot

Money makes the world go round

I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday

I called on dear old Santa Claus

To see what I could see

He took me to his workshop

And told his plans to me, so
 

You better watch out, you better not cry

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Santa Claus is comin to town

He's making a list and checking it twice

Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

Santa Claus is comin to town

He sees you when you're sleepin 
He knows when you're a wake

He knows if you've been bad or good

So be good for goodness sake

Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Santa Claus is comin to town
With little tin horns and little toy drums

Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums

Santa Claus is comin to town

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo

Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too

Santa Claus is comin to town

Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree

So! You better watch out, you better not cry

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Santa Claus is comin to town
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day

You'd better write your letter now

And mail it right away

Because he's getting ready

His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums

Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums

Santa Claus is comin to town

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo

Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too

Santa Claus is comin to town

Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree

So! You better watch out, you better not cry

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Santa Claus is comin to town

You used to laugh at everything I said baby

Now you play me like my jokes are old
 

And girl we used to talk about everything

Like make love until we're old and grey

And all these photo... I took

You don't give me the same love

And when I ask you, you say everything is okay

Well I'm not feeling the love no more

And although I see you standing there I can't find you anywhere

Well I'm not feeling the love no more

Tell me how where we go wrong
Feels like I'm living all alone in this old house

Cause you're distance brings the worst of you

It's like a battle of silence... for

Cause it seems I'm just a ghost to you
 
I remember we used to make love through the night

And we we're doing it til the morning light

Put you are not there
 

Well I'm not feeling the love no more

And although I see you standing there I can't find you anywhere

Well I'm not feeling the love no more

Tell me how where we go wrong

It's been seven hours and fifteen days

Since you took your love away

I go out every night and sleep all day

Since you took your love away

Since you been gone I can do whatever I want

I can see whomever I choose

I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant

But nothing

I said nothing can take away these blues

Cause nothing compares

Nothing compares to you
It's been so lonely without you here

Like a bird without a song

Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling

Tell me baby where did I go wrong

I could put my arms around every boy I see

But they'd only remind me of you

I went to the doctor guess what he told me

Guess what he told me

He said girl you better try to have fun no matter what you do

but he's a fool

Cause nothing compares 2 you
All the flowers that you planted mama

In the back yard

All died when you went away

I know that living with you baby was sometimes hard

But I'm willing to give it another try

Cause nothing compares

Nothing compares to you

Roll roll roll

And there they all go

I said " , go up to that third block and flip a you-turn

Lyric clips ready? ready ready"
 

Hit the gas, put on a ski mask, right when we pass...

So what you think, are?dd? smoke that ass

This ain't a game, straight up reality

Made by the streets, done by insanity

Drive-by, yes, it's the season

When the Ganxta kills for no reason

When an MC is slippin on the front porch

Stick em like a pitch fork, this is not New York

This is a concept comin from L.A.

The West Coast comin with the war braids

So you know we're ready, Roscoe, is the hit squad ready?

Yes, they're ready

It's a clip to an Uzi that I insert

And at the show I unload at the concert

Yes, you just got tagged

Rolled to the bodybag is like rollin up a zig-zag

I can go on and on, tellin you war stories

About gangstas dyin for a territory

We claim the stage like the boulevard

It's only for those who are hard

Hardcore, we give you more

Cause the bass is bumpin from the third floor

So you look up and all you see is the T.R.I.B.E.

You have a teardrop tacked to your eye

25 to life, so you better get with it

You ask who did it, the Ganxta are?dd did it
 

Once upon a drive-by it was me and the Ganxta are?dd

MC's try to sweat the dawg, this is what he did

 

Time is tickin, the world's gone bad

You ain't with it, you better step back

Feel the wrath of the Ganxta are?dd

 

Damn, that's a hard-ass lyric!

 

Time is tickin, the world's gone bad

You ain't with it, you better step back

Feel the wrath of the Ganxta are?dd
 

That's how it is in the streets of L.A.

People gettin killed today

You smile now and later you die

By a drive-by, you only have time to see the bullets fly

On the news it was televised

An Astrovan on Daytons strolled by

You think I lie? O.M.B. supplies the R.I.-

P. to the busters in front of me

Sweat that ass every time he sees me

Cause I hold the mic and stomp

Cuttin your head on a tree stump, watch the crowd I pump

When it's quiet on the set E.K.A. gets upset

Fuck that shit, Ganxta are?dd's up next

And this is a death threat

Time after time you forget

That this is a drive-by hit

Fuck a Dayton-stealer

Don-L the K.O.D. is the walk-by ladykiller

Then I turn to the R...

Rock, Roscoe, Rob and Rook

And the are?dd, yeah, he's the microphone crook

O is the left hook

Like when Brooklyn comes to L.A., you get took

So analyze the outlook

The old days a drive-by was heavy

Cause it was done by Machinegun Kelly

The new days this game is to live or die

In L.A. once upon a drive-by
 

Once upon a drive-by it was me and the Ganxta are?dd

MC's try to sweat the dawg, this is what he did

 

Time is tickin, the world's gone bad

You ain't with it, you better step back

Feel the wrath of the Ganxta are?dd

 

Damn, that's a hard-ass lyric!

 

Time is tickin, the world's gone bad

You ain't with it, you better step back

Feel the wrath of the Ganxta are?dd
 
 

It can't be stopped, and it's comin like a blindside

Once upon a drive-by came from the westside

Yes, all you can do is wet your lips

Hopin you don't get hit by the next lyric clip

I turn down the bass so I can feel ya

Ganxta are?dd is the microphone killer

You just got smoked cause the gangsta in me is loc'ed

Stop jackin for spokes

Or else you get picked on O. Mobsta Bass bomb

Another gangsta from the funk farm

This one is created

By the are, muthafucka, who stated

That this jam is rated are

That was the last seminar

We witness a murder on the boulevard

Yes, we just been spotted, spotted on the radar

Soldiers sent from the ?????

Cause we're comin in too hard

Too hard too hard too hard
 


Yeah whoa~

I dropped a tear in the ocean eh

And when you find it

That's the day I'll stop loving you

C'mon
If I have only one day on this earth whoa

I'll live tonight, I'll spend tonight, make love tonight

I'll sleep tonight with you by my side

And if I have only one day on this earth whoa

Then I'll laugh tonight, I'll cry tonight, I'll make it right

Spend the rest of my time with you by my side
If my time was slipping away

And I didn't have long to live

I'd appreciate the time we've shared

And I won't want you to shed a tear

If the road was coming to an end

And I couldn't turn this car around

I know faith will get us, get us through the wind

And I'll be somewhere on heaven's ground
If I have only one day on this earth whoa

I'll live tonight, I'll spend tonight, make love tonight

I'll sleep tonight with you by my side

And if I have only one day on this earth whoa

Then I'll laugh tonight, I'll cry tonight, I'll make it right

Spend the rest of my time with you by my side
Now if this life gets the best of me

And all the fame starts to fade away

Just know our love made history

And know that life is a better place

If there's nothing on the television

That the world was gonna end today

Girl I'll be on a mission

To love you the rest of the night away

If I had one..
If I have only one day on this earth whoa

I'll live tonight, I'll spend tonight, make love tonight

I'll sleep tonight with you by my side

and if I have only one day on this earth whoa

Then I'll laugh tonight, I'll cry tonight, I'll make it right

Spend the rest of my time with you by my side
We could see the sunrise

We could see the stars bliss

Make love in the moonlight

I'll make you my bucketless

We gone shop like no tomorrow

Live it up like no tomorrow

Pop champagne like no tomorrow

In the club like no tomorrow
You can have anything you like

You're my girl I'm gonna treat you right

And when I shine you shine

So have fun you only get one night

And they all hating you

Diamond on you're face you behind and back

They wanna take your place

You can see no never ever

We gone run forever

We gone be together

Til forever and ever
If I have only one day on this earth whoa

I'll live tonight, I'll spend tonight, make love tonight

I'll sleep tonight with you by my side

and If I have only one day on this earth whoa

then I'll laugh tonight, I'll cry tonight, I'll make it right

spend the rest of my time with you by my side

From, my iPhone to my sidekick

Jet planes, schedule hectic

Had a fast car, but I wrecked it

Plenty chances to fall in love man

So many weekends, I went to clubs man

In the fast lane, my life's a picture flick

Now I was in a real bad abusive relationship

Knowing that, that was no way for me to live

A young girl like me, raised up in a good family

Way too young to endure such misery

And every night I cry myself to sleep from all the pain

And the more I prayed for sunny days it seemed to rain

He hit me at any given time

He hit me no reason at all

He hit me so so hard

He hit me my God, sometimes I'd fall

But on my grades I would get nothing but all D's

And the coach came to me and had a talk with me about my career

Said if you don't get your grades up

I'm gonna have to sit you down this year

Man as tough as I was I brake down and cry cause

Everybody knows me, knows that basketball is my life

Algebra I studied hard

Chemistry I gave my all

Calculus oh my God

English so many flaws

Playing ball didn't look to good for me

My future, could not see

I had lost all my beliefs

And gave up on all my dreams

Then I went to church on Sunday

And the pastor began to preach

In Christ that strengthens me

And for me that was enough

We were separated at least for a month or two

She was wilding in the clubs

And I was out there doing wrong too

And we would walk around the house

Putting each other down

We would curse each other out

Then I was in a bad accident

And almost lost my life

Coming from the pinnacle

Oh, what a welcoming
 

Been to the black rock

Found my salvation

Rendered me patient

But wearing me thin

So I'm
 

On the way back home

Seen the big show, thousand times

Got to get back what is mine

The only way I know

Feet been walking, thousand miles

Got to get back what is mine
Bless the evening, it's showed the way

Back to where it all began

Oh, undercover I made my case

I'm quietly a gentleman

Man, To be a fool is such a waste

Down low double life

1, 2 equals us, she, she and me, I fell in loves

How could something so right go so wrong

Just coming in on flight 412

But she was listening on the phone

I thought I had it all together

But I was wrong obviously

cause what was once done in the dark

Came to light eventually
1 - Living down low, down low

Living that double life

Living down low, down low

Living that double life

It ain't right
I don't believe the shit I did the night we were at your mom's

I got a page from out of town, lied and said it was my job

Grabbed my hat, coat, gloves and scarf

I told you that I would return

But by the look upon your face you had already discerned

You pulled me to the side and you begged for me to stay

But I was caught up in a life that forced me to walk away
Repeat 1
Okay you, you're saying you came in and

And these two women they, they poured

Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, it wasn't nothing like that

All I know is uh, I was asleep, they came in

Woke me up pourin hot grits

And all kinds of shit on me man, okay beatin me and shit

Hittin me with all sorts of type shit Damn
With a cigar in my mouth over Vegas city lights

On a path way up the hill to be with my other wife

A rich nigga living strife going on like nothing's wrong

But that damn Caller ID is the reason for this song

So one called up the other while I was out playing some golf

Talking bout my doggish ways and how I need to be droppped off
Repeat 1
Now go ahead, shoot me now because I'm guilty as sin

Playin Russian roulette with hearts not to mention the kids

Now every day I live I regret all that I did

Out smoking with friends as I reminisced
Repeat 1
I can't take it no more I've got to confess

See now, I don't know why

I thought that I could keep creeping

cause you see what goes around

Comes back on around and back on around

And back on around again, yes it does

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

In a state of shock that's what it left me

Take it from a man who knows

That three ain't company

No, no, no that's what I kept telling myself

Now I done lost the houses the kids and the dogs

Now I'm sleeping in my momma's house

And even she says, your sorry ass don't deserve no help

Must be because of what my old man did to her

Niggas

Can you hear the sounds of the love angels calling us

Sweet violins,and harps playing

Then suddenly there's this kiss of trust

Damper than the morning dew,tonight has chosen me and you

And girl I vow to make everyone of your fantasies come true
I can here the horns sounding,

Bells ringing a full orchestra

And the choir singing

The oceans calm and the rivers flowing

It feels so good, keep on going.
Rain drops keep fallin on our heads,as we make love

We won't stop the rain keeps fallin down on both of us.

Rain drops keep fallin on our heads, as we make love

We won't stop the rain keeps fallin down on both of us.
Can you see the flowers blooming,slowly as the seasons change,

The gift of joy is found in when I softly here you call my name

Rose pedals, and all these oils, surrounded by a hundred candles,

The eagle delivers a letter, that says this night will last forever.
Damper than the morning dew,the night has chosen me and you

And girl I promise to make everyone of your fantasies come tru
I can here the horns sounding, bells ringing a full orchestra

And the choir singing.the oceans calm and the rivers flowing

Don't you stop, just keep on going.
Rain drops keep fallin on our heads,as we make love

We won't stop the rain keeps fallin down on both of us.

Rain drops keep fallin on our heads, as we make love

We won't stop the rain keeps fallin down on both of us.
Through all the trees, the smooth wind blows,then suddenly a rainbow

An ocean filled with white sail boats and huge waterfalls that overflow

? and fairy tales

?

And imagine far away from here,

Where the land cry's joyful tears,
 

Rain drops keep fallin on our heads,as we make love

We won't stop the rain keeps fallin down on both of us.

Rain drops keep fallin on our heads,as we make love

We won't stop the rain keeps fallin down on both of us.

Do I know your friend who?

At a club?

Who was there?

Girl I wouldn't

Wait a minute, calm down

I was at the club with who?

Get the fuck...man, you know what
Girl I'm not about to sit up here and argue with you about who's to blame

I call no names, real talk

See girl, only thing I'm trying to establish with you is not

Who's right or who's wrong, but what's right and what's wrong

Real talk

Just because your friend say she saw me at a club with some other bitches

Sitting in VIP, smoking and drinking and kicking it, tell me girl
Did she say there were other guys there?

Did she say there were other guys there?

Were there other guys there?

Well, tell me this
How the fuck she knew I was with them other girls then

When the whole club packed wait a minute let me finish what I've got to say

I've been with you five years and you listening to your motherfucking girlfriends

I don't know why you fuck with them all jealous no man havin ass holes anyway

Real talk

Alway accusing me of some old bullshit when I'm just trying to have a good time

Robert you did this, Kellz I heard you did that
 


She didn't have a house, a house up in the hills

I never heard her ask for some car with the chromed out wheels

But all she wanted was some love and affection

But all I did all the time was neglect

The fact that she was lonely, I used to be her homey

I used to talk about how I was gonna get us out of the hood

But as long as we're together as a family, then it's all good
 

Because any man can make a baby

But it takes a real man to be a father

Talking bout a family, the kid, you and me

It's not a fantasy, but it's reality

You see love is wrong and love is right

But if love is strong then love is tight

Talking bout a chemistry like a bride-to-be

It's not a fantasy, but it's reality
Be careful were the words the last time we had our talk

And your truth sound absurd so my pride just let you walk

When all the time knowing that I didn't mean

To hollar out and call you bitch and tell you leave

I admit it, I was wrong but now it's over come on home

I can't take it here is where you belong

Even out the window looking for the mailman

I hope he's got a letter says, I'm missing you, in the mail

And then I saw you with another, made it hard for me to breathe

But when I played the game for gives

I should've played the game for keeps
 
Now I wore the shoes that you talked about in your song

But it's been a change I've got a new pair on, yes

Now every night and day I still await

At the lonely spot in the hills

And think about how you set the record straight

Any man can

A religious love for you baby

Every night I pray

That heaven will send you back to me

Baby you're all I ever needed
Dearly beloved, why did you go

When being with you forever is all I hope

Slowly the rain is falling in our home

Come back and start right from going wrong

I'll be still until I hear from you

And I'll be waiting until you return this message
 

A religious love for you baby

Every night I pray

Baby you're all I ever needed

A religious love for ya baby

Every night I pray

That someday I'll have you for my wife

Baby you are my life, please believe me
For only God knows how much I miss you

And for us to be as one it takes two

So don't you go dying on me not right now

Please change the impossible to somehow

I'll be still there until I hear from you

And I'll be praying until you return this message
 
In the middle of the night, I'll be callin you

Every single breath I take I hope to see you there

If you should ever need, if ever you need a friend

Baby I am here and don't forget to remember me
Oh baby, come to me, don't leave me lonely

"The victims are what mean the most to us and that we cared so much about..."

"I just really feel that we are going to be known as the school that overcame"
I know you're feeling pain right now

And you don't wanna talk right now

I know you're going through something

And you don't wanna be bothered right now

Not gonna lie and say I understand

I just wanna be here for you if I can

To hold your hand and be by your side

And together we will get through these times
 

And we will cry together

And we'll fight this together

And we'll be strong together

Stand together, pray together
 

Rise up, when you feel you can't go on

Rise up, when all of your hope is gone

Rise up, when you're weak and you can't be strong

Rise, rise up

Rise up, and when the tears start to fall

Rise up, and you feel you've given it your all

Rise up, when your back is up against the wall

Rise, rise up
Now I know the burdens that you've had

And you don't think nobody cares

A storm comes out of nowhere

And you're feeling like it just ain't fair

Not here to preach about the private side, no

Cause I understand and now is not the time

See I just wanna help you make it right

Walk with you, holding the candle light
 
 
You see struggle so hard

No color, no color

And you missed the price

You are my sister

I'm your brother

And side by side we'll face this thing

Standing tall, you and me
Rise up, rise

Rise up, rise

Rise up, rise
Hey we gon rise
Rise up, rise

Rise up, rise

Kellz

I'm back nigga

Y'all thought I was gone

Nope Nope

Let's go
 

Rollin

Coming out through the candy colored doors

Catch me hopping up and down on 24's

Rollin 
I be rollin 
I be rollin 
I be rollin 
When I was down you bitches didn't want to be my friends

And now I'm rollin all you bitches want to hop in

Rollin 
I be rollin 
I be rollin 
I be rollin I'm going toot toot, beep beep

Pulling up on them wheels now

All black no doubt bout it

And a shot up much like a seal now

Got them cars in my garage

No less than a mil now

Kellz about to take the bar

And I'm a set it real high

Double take, double take

When I roll up to the club

Players hate, players hate

When I walk up in the club

I got them shades on doing about 75

Just call me speed racer cause I'm rollin in at mach 5

Y'all niggas ain't fucking with me

And I put a mil on it

Niggas and bitches they lie

But home boy them stats don't

R & B Boss
Hustling like Rick Ross

Man my flow is so raw

So niggas don't piss me off

I'm a player homie and that's a well known factor

Plus the wheels on that coup got it looking like a tractor

Take my ice hold it up

Then my city toss it up

Chi town, summer time

Kellz got traffic backed up
 
Yellow ice

Cash money, I got cash money

Just to hear them horses go

Vrrmm

I spent that cash money

As for the haters, they ass funny

My money like a road block

So watch how you roll roll your crash dummy

I'm rolling in, I roll and bounce, I roll and stop

Roll slow motion, then I let the beat drop

Honies love it when I roll up on them wheels

Top down, looking fly,

Climbing on them wheels

I got them 24's on that coup

You know they chop and spin

Put an S on my maybach cause that's my super Benz

I own a nightlight shining when I roll through

Hop out that Zerogi 101 color Smurf blue

Silver bullet Lex Jeep parked out at my beach home

Think I'm from the swamp the way I step out with them gators on

On the hood of that old school, I be smoking trees on it

Just copped a Cadillac, I'm about to throw some D's on it
 
 


This song goes out to my mother

The one I love

And the one I lost

When it comes down to her

Thinkin about what my mother's done for me

The love she's given me

Makes it easy to do a song like this

So this one's for you ma

I love you
Early one Sunday morning

Breakfast was on the table

There was no time to eat

She said to me

Boy hurry to Sunday school
Filled with the long of glory

We learned the holy story

She'll always have her dreams

Despite the things this troubled world can bring
Oh Sadie

Don't you know we love you sweet Sadie

Place no one above you sweet Sadie

Well well well living in the past
Sometimes it seems so funny

No money can turn your life around

Sweeter than cotton candy

Stronger than papas old brandy

Always that needed smile

Once in awhile she would break down and cry
Sometimes she'd be so happy

Being with us and daddy

Standing the worst of times

Breaking the binds with just a simple song
Oh Sadie maiden

She's loving my song in a special way

Well, well, well

Sweet Sadie

Living in the past
Oh she's never sinning

In love she's always winning yeah

My my my my my

I love you mama
I just can't forget

How you gave me love, oh no

If there's a Heaven up above

I know she's teaching angels how to love

It's a mean world without you

And I surely miss you much mother
And now that you're gone

I'm gonna carry on

Cause your're cryin lady, woah Sadie

When I think about the things that you done for me

Hey it brings a joy way down deep inside of me, yeah woh
See I love you mama

Yes I do

I'll never forget you mother

No oh ho, no oh ho

This song goes out

To all the people out there that be running they mouth

And they don't know what

The hell they sayin 
Shut up!
Now that I've got my voice back let me start off sayin that

I appreciate the fans around the world that had my back

And I just wanna thank God upstairs for keeping His hands on me

And keeping all the doctors focused through my surgery

Now, there's a couple of things I gotta get off my chest

Some serious issues that I must address so

Well, let's just get right to people said that I was done

Said there was no way this time he's gonna over come

And even before the doctors was done and I could awake

A tsunami of rumors had come to wipe my career away

After twenty two years of a blessed career

Had me lying in my hospital bed crying mad tears ooh

But just as I have many people hatin me

Had so many people loving me

And let's not forget the hood around the world covering me

And to everybody that be calling me

Telling what they've been sayin about me

Bringin all of this negative shit and

Y'all the ones I ain't fucking with

It's time for me to evaluate the people that I let up in my space

Can I get a witness for all of this

When people all up in your business
Tell em shut up, tell em shut up

Tell em shut up!

I'm talking to you

Tell em all shut up,

Tell em all shut up

Tell em all shut up

And tell em, I'm talking to you
He's washed up, he's lost it

He ain't gotta no more

Well I'm here to tell you today boy you haters are so slow

And it saddens me to know

Some of y'all want me to go away

Well when it's time for me to go

My God is gonna orchestrate

Until then I will accept the stones

Pray and try to get along but sometimes it's so hard for me to be strong

See I got kids and I'm tryin to love em

So many things that I'm tryin to juggle

But I never thought this music would become my struggle oh

The news said I lost my house my own people put me down

And my friends no longer around no

But you see deep underneath the surface

I feel something's working in my behalf a victory is near yeah

See my future ain't my past it's not the end of the hour glass

Who said it would not last

Fans sick they ass
Tell em shut up, shut up, shut up

Tell em shut up, I'm talking

I'm talking to you, shut ooh, shut up, shut up, shut up y'all

Shut up, if you talking bout me I'm talking to you
Now seriously after all these hits and melodies and memories

You compare me to someone else O-M-G

Now no offense to the other artist but come on dawg

Let's be honest how many babies been made off me O-M-G

Seriously you gonna act like that

Sit there like it ain't no truth to that

Looking at me like I ain't talking stats O-M-G

Every boy, every girl, every child around the world

From the 90's up until today was made off me
Shut up, shut up, shut up

Somebody's girl is at this party woo!

Shakin that ass to this uh-huh

Somebody's girl is at this party woo!

Drink that glass of Cris that's right

Somebody's girl is at this party uh

Sittin in V.I.P.

Somebody's girl yeah is at this party that's right

And she's comin home with me
Ummmmmm I don't mean no harm

But your boy young Hov got a mean ol arm

Got all the young ladies wanna lean on him

And I don't turn them away, I'm like, bring them on

Now, where's her man is not my concern

It's not what I'm worried about, I'm just tryin to hurry her out

Clear her whole area out

And bring this whole party little nearer to my house

Now, where's her spouse? I don't know

So, I don't ask, I don't probe

I just, get in six, get out on Rov 
Let her, sip on Cris  go out on tours

Now, back at the lab, I'm actin bad

Cause the, pool is warm, a booze is on

Just a - select few, the fools are gone

It's slow jams and the grooves is on, groove on
Somebody's girl is at this party

Shakin that ass to this

Somebody's girl is at this party

Drink that glass of Cris 
Somebody's girl is at this party

Sittin in V.I.P.

Somebody's girl is at this party

And she's comin home with me
Uhh, is it my fault they call me young heat rock

Hardhead, go through walls like sheet rock

And she's comin with me, when the beat stop

When the party is done, I party with hon

Now, is it my fault you neglect your broad

And she wanna party with me, no ex at all?

No ex-boyfriend, no ex involved

Just the highway exit that we exit off

And I, fall back, I let her talk

I inquire sometime, I admire her mind

I, like her wit, I'm lovin her shoes

I'm a alternative rap, I'm playin the blues

I'm a thorough street nigga never breakin the rules

And her man's shortcomin is turnin me into somethin 
That of which she has never seen

So she wanna crossover where the grass is green, knahmean?
Somebody's girl is at this party

Shakin that ass to this

Somebody's girl is at this party

Drink that glass of Cris 
Somebody's girl is at this party

Sittin in V.I.P.

Somebody's girl is at this party

And she's comin home with me
The moral of the story if you love your bitch

You better - hold your hoe, hug your bitch

You better - slow your roll, trick some bread

When she wanna go out, you like Craig and em said

"See ya when I see ya," now she's callin me up

And I'm like, "Geah, of course I wanna chill"

Now she with the real, and you all fed

Like, "I'ma crack her motherfuckin fo'head!"
Somebody's girl is at this party

Shakin that ass to this

Somebody's girl is at this party

Drink that glass of Cris 
Somebody's girl is at this party

Sittin in V.I.P.

Somebody's girl is at this party

And she's comin home with me

Young Hov got the block on smash

Put the ? on the truck for I drop the rag

Bitches want to bring up the topic of my past

It's legendary in the hood how I got my cash

I'm legendady in the hood so I got the mag

And I've never been a fronter so I've got to blast

Will I flash... Not...

As I'm not playing with you motherfuckers the casket drops

You bastards not gon assassinate the name I got

Young Hov got the block on smash

And everybody and their momma want to stop my cash

Everybody want drama with the top of the brass

Til I come through hop out the cab

Stop Somebody gon Drop Ya'll hear me though...
Aiyo I cannot Stop, I will not Stop

AS WE PROCEED
Young Hov got the game in a frenzy

Twenty million sold all independently

So when you mention me

Make sure you got together your semblies

Like "he's the games J.F.Kennedy"

I started out I ain't have no chimney

My ma was Santa Claus, well at least she pretended to be

Til one night, well that's if memory serves me correct I caught her under

the Christmas tree

Young Hov ain't have no pops

Thank God man I had the block

Ya'll hear me though

You young fucks got the game all wrong

This is my life man this ain't no song

You ain't livin your rhymes out, you live at your mom's house

In that tight-ass room, pullin the cars out

And the mirror pointin at your reflection, killing yourself

You American Pie, stop feeling yourself

Nigga, you just a worker, go deal yourself

Stop being a server, get a meal yourself

Where your heart at, all that yick-yack, ain't nobody scared of your gats

We got bigger ones

How many niggas done shot at me shivering

They were so scared they ain't hit me once

Young Hov bout to go to the range

Bout to work on perfecting my aim
Aiyo I cannot Stop, I will not Stop

AS WE PROCEED
 


I was in a tunnel

And couldn't see the light

And whenever I'd look up

I couldn't see the sky

Sometimes when I'm standin 
It seems like I done walked for miles

And my heart could be cryin 
Dead in the middle of a smile
But then I climbed the hills

And saw the mountains

I hollered help cause I was lost

Then I felt the strong wind

Heard a small voice sayin The storm is over

The storm is over now

And I can see the sunshine

Somewhere beyond the clouds

I feel Heaven, yeah

Heaven is over me

Come on and set me free, whoa
Now in the midst of my battle

All hope was gone

Downtown in a rushed crowd

And felt all alone

And every now and then

I felt like I would lose my mind

I've been racin for years

And still no finish line, oh
But then I climbed the hills

And saw the mountains Mountains

I hollered help cause I was lost

Then I felt the strong wind

And then a small voice sayin The storm is over

The storm is over now

And I can see the sunshine

Somewhere beyond the clouds

I can feel Heaven, yeah

Heaven is over me
Come on and set me free

Somehow my beginning stepped right in Right in

Then faith became my friend My friend

And now I can depend

On the voices of the wind

When it's sayin Sayin The storm is over

The storm is over now

And I can see the sunshine

Somewhere beyond the clouds

I can feel Heaven, yeah

Heaven is over me
Won't you come and set me free

Won't you set me free
The storm is over

The storm is over now

And I can see the sunshine

Somewhere beyond the clouds

I can feel Heaven, yeah

Heaven is over me

Won't you come and set me free
 
 


Suddenly I feel like I want to break loose

Jump in my six and come and see you

Girl I'm gonna do something that's brand new

Cause I got a kinky surprise for you

So girl get ready cause I'm on my way

Put your sexy body in some neglege

And if you feel it let me know it right now

Baby this is ow it's all going down

There'll be
 

Three knocks on the door my baby

Trench coat hits the floor my baby

Sit back in the chair my baby

Cause I'm about to go there my baby

And get your body real open baby

Do what you been hoping baby

Tonight I'm gonna do a switcheroo

Do you mind if I strip for you
I'ma stop and get some gas my baby

Give you time to freshen up my baby

And if you want just leave the door unlocked

I'll be creeping in by twelve o'clock

So turn the telephones off my baby

No interruptions while I'm driving you crazy

Girl I want you to know tonight is yours

Start in the bed and end up on the floor

There'll be
 
 

You'll be watching You'll be watching

Slowly rolling Slowly rolling

For you For you, baby. Whatever you want me to do I will do

Girl, I promise Baby I promise

You'll not regret You won't regret it

And everything that you ever want I will strip to the bone and just let you get on it girl
 
 


 

I say the easiest thing in the world

Is to love you

And the hardest thing in the world

Is to lose you
Said I tried and tried again to keep you

But it just ain't no use

I'm baffled cause of what went down

See I got your letter so you're leaving town

Just take one minute to think about

Baby, lets back track on what happened in this house

Now I remember clearly it was a Saturday

I came walkin in four o'clock in the morning

And I thought you were sleepin one eye opened

You turned and said to me where the hell you been

Then I turned it around and hollared with some friends drinking

And now I'm sitting here all alone

Wishing you were here to house this home, oh
Say the easiest thing in the world is to love you

I love you baby

And the hardest thing in the world So hard

Is to lose you Is to lose you baby
 

Now I'm sitting here sippin on things

I'm not suppose to Sittin right here

And that ain't cool You know that ain't cool

I've got to get over losing you
Shattered I can't believe you're gone

I'm left in the middle of these four walls

Lying helpless bout to lose my mind baby

I can't fathom life without you by my side

Now every night before I go to sleep

I pray to heaven for a better me

Nights I'm up thinkin and days I'm up dreamin 
You were at work I was at play

A nigga wanted you and plus his cake

I know I ain't got no right to say

But I need you to head on back this way

Because I'm sitting here all alone

Wishing you were here to house this home
 
 
Baby can't we just moan for love like we used to
 
 
See, sometimes we men, we can dish it out

But sometimes we men, we can't take it, hey

So I'm gonna get up out this chair

And catch me a train, and get where you are, hey

Because I love you babe

And I need you

Right here by my side

Ghetto woman come on home to me

I'm dying sorry and I can't seem to break free

The thick stitched seam and her favorite ass jeans

Y'all know the first date wearers

To make objects bigger than they appear like a rear view mirror

She gave em the Christian Libountins? with the four inch heels

But honestly my favorite type of gear

Is a scrungy for her hair and LaPearla underwear, clear?

Bright nigh, street lights and a city that never sleeps

Loud music and talks people where all the party sings

I saw a girl and I noticed that she noticed me

We sipped mojitos then she told me all about her dreams

Then we made love in a taxi cab,

It reminded me of a dream I had

Now the memory's like a photograph

And I can't get her out of my head oh
Made love in a taxi cab, taxi cab, taxi cab

Made love in a taxi cab, taxi cab, taxi cab

Made love in a taxi cab, taxi cab
And the shorty's, knows she's there

I come alone, I come alone, that's what she said

I come alone, come alone, to me
Looking at the rear view

She said to me let go and be free

Then she told the driver

Mind his business and then went there on me
Then I told her

We're just fifteen minutes from my home

But she didn't stop,

She kept saying it feels so incredible wrong
Then we made love in a taxi cab,

It reminded me of a dream I had

Now the memory's like a photograph oh baby girl,

And I can't get her out of my head

Last night, made love in a taxi cab, taxi cab, taxi cab

Last night, made love in a taxi cab, taxi cab, taxi cab

Last night, made love in a taxi cab, taxi cab

And the shorty's, knows she's there
And all happened so soon, girl

I didn't even get a name, she took control and had her way

And it was like a hotel room yea

We're taking a gamble but people love to bet
And we made love in a taxi cab,

Reminded me of a dream I had

Now the memory's like a photograph

And I can't get her out of my head oh

Last night Last night

Made love in a taxi cab, taxi cab, taxi cab

Last night Last night

Made love in a taxi cab, taxi cab, taxi cab

Last night Last night

Made love in a taxi cab, taxi cab, taxi cab

And the shorty's, knows she's there
Think I love her

The girl's meant for me

Last night

Made love in a taxi cab, taxi cab, taxi cab

Last night

Made love in a taxi cab, taxi cab, taxi cab

Last night

Made love in a taxi cab, taxi cab, taxi cab
Then we made love in a taxi cab,

It reminded me of a dream I had

Now the memory's like a photograph,

And I can't get her out of my head.

Where I come from

Who could believe

All the pain and misery

Look in my eyes and you'll see

The diary of me
Rewind my life

Just go back and correct all the wrong

And ask God to direct my path

So that I can make it home

And if I could turn back the hands of time

There would be some things I would change about me

But I know that my past is not what my future holds

Cause
Where I'm from

Who could believe

All the pain, misery

Look in my eyes and you will see

The diary of me
Years ago a child was born a child was born ooh

And raised without a man without my father, and wonder why he's in these streets ooh
My mother's gone mothers gone, yet still found the strength to pray for me ooh

But still reached out her hand

Just open the book na-na-na-na-na-na

Turn the pages of my life na-na-na

Hurtin people feelings like he didn't have a conscience

Like I love you  when he's hittin that stash

Then degraded, the shorty, like he didn't have class
Even let a gay Jew man tack his Jheri

Then got the nerve to call the next cat a fairy

Swindlin  forgot the God above him

Finally fan base trinklin down to nothin No concern for his estate, though, was yearnin for a break

Bitter an evil, didn't learn from his mistake

The moral of the story is Don't be a pair of knickers

Be good, boys an girls an you can be as great as Rick is In this arena, arena

All we wanna see is them hands up, hands up

This is for them hustlin boys an girls

It's the return of Best of Both Worlds
In this arena, arena

All we wanna see is them hands up, hands up

This is for them hustlin boys an girls

I was in a tunnel

And couldn't see the light

And whenever I'd look up

I couldn't see the sky

Sometimes when I'm standin 
It seems like I done walked for miles

And my heart could be cryin 
Dead in the middle of a smile
But then I climbed the hills

And saw the mountains

I hollered help cause I was lost

Then I felt the strong wind

Heard a small voice sayin The storm is over

The storm is over now

And I can see the sunshine

Somewhere beyond the clouds

I feel Heaven, yeah

Heaven is over me

Come on and set me free, whoa
Now in the midst of my battle

All hope was gone

Downtown in a rushed crowd

And felt all alone

And every now and then

I felt like I would lose my mind

I've been racin for years

And still no finish line, oh
But then I climbed the hills

And saw the mountains Mountains

I hollered help cause I was lost

Then I felt the strong wind

And then a small voice sayin The storm is over

The storm is over now

And I can see the sunshine

Somewhere beyond the clouds

I can feel Heaven, yeah

Heaven is over me
Come on and set me free
Somehow my beginning stepped right in Right in

Then faith became my friend My friend

And now I can depend

On the voices of the wind

When it's sayin Sayin The storm is over

The storm is over now

And I can see the sunshine

Somewhere beyond the clouds

I can feel Heaven, yeah

Heaven is over me
Won't you come and set me free

Won't you set me free
The storm is over

The storm is over now

And I can see the sunshine

Somewhere beyond the clouds

I can feel Heaven, yeah

Heaven is over me

Won't you come and set me free
 
 


Dear God, how can I explain myself?

Oh God, bless me indeed when I'm so confused

Enlarge my territory

Place Your love and protection over me at all times

Help me

Keep me away from evil, somebody answer me

Allow me not to cause pain
Police in the background, screamin  "Put the thing down"

That's how hard I was trying to put my thing down

Sirens ringin out, old ladies screamin out

All this attention for me and I'm barely sixteen now
It's feelin like a dream now

Handcuffed, roughed up, I'm tossed in the bing now

I'm lyin next to fiends now, that's the end of the story

Let me bring y'all niggaz back to the very first scene now
December 4th, a child is born

Before I knew it, had my pops trousers on

That's how we do it when the man of the house is gone

You either stand or fall, I chose to stand
The hawk outside, so I blow my hand

It's a cold, cold world but I overstand

Tryin to stay focused but I feel hopeless damn

Can't cope with bein broke, I'm a man, c'mon
Son, don't let these streets, get the best of you

I will be right by your side, when you goin through

Son, just don't let it

Just don't let it

Just don't let it

Just don't let it

Just don't let it

Just don't let it

Get the best of you
Late one night I was rollin the streets

Just thinkin about what's goin on with me

And trapped in this thug life, tryin to break free

But this thug life just keeps callin me
I'm livin life way too dangerously

I'm drownin in my misery

Looked in the mirror, there's my enemy

Cause poppa never was a part of me
"Take one step at a time", mama said

Sweet memories still remain in my head

All of my life been lied to, misled

Voices be like, "Don't you wish you was dead?"
No ground to place my feet, I feel the fire under me

A way out is all I need, somebody, answer me
Son, don't let these streets, get the best of you

I will be right by your side, when you goin through

Son, just don't let it

Just don't let it

Just don't let it

Just don't let it

Just don't let it

Just don't let it

Get the best of you
Now the only thing left is more spirit to roam free

Cause ain't no goin home for me

It's a cold, cold world but I blew my hand

A true first cause I knew that man
I knew what he would do if I didn't draw first

And I couldn't stand the thought of

My momma steppin foot inside a church

All I try to do is try to get up out the dirt
Guess, he's tryin to do the same

Told me, get up out his turf

I wanted to talk to him but that shit'd never work
We was cut from the same cloth

And what was under his shirt was his momma's rent

His young brother's clothes, my nephew's food

And with that I suppose and with that I froze
Now my life is frozen in time behind these iron folds

And this story is told for young soldiers

Who never choose the life we chose
Son, don't let these streets, get the best of you

I will be right by your side, when you goin through

Son, just don't let it

Just don't let it

Just don't let it

Just don't let it

Just don't let it

Just don't let it

Get the best of you
Tears in my eyes as I look up

I'm tryin to hold back my pride but reality is screamin 
Gotta get a job cause momma also screamin 
Streets are just like drugs and it's like I'm out here fiendin Forget all the hits in the industry

Cause ain't no exceptions in this game for me

Look, neither God or my enemies

I choose God cause He understands
This young man with a thuggish heart

Whole world in his hands but still torn apart

Like I'm so close but it's still so far

Nightmares of me in a swervin car, oh
No ground to place my feet

My feet

I feel the fire under me

Hey

A way out is all I need

All I need

Somebody answer me
Son, don't let these streets, get the best of you

I will be right by your side, when you goin through

Son, just don't let it

Just don't let it

Just don't let it

Just don't let it

Just don't let it

Just don't let it

Get the best of you

Girl you just don't know

Last night was incredible. Listen. Check it out.
Last night, I felt the skies open up and rain down heaven

Last night, I felt the sun, the moon and the stars come together

Last night, I heard an angel speak to me he said us forever

And while we were making love, I saw visions of a tropical river
Last night I

Touched a dream

When you were here with me

Last night I

Touched a dream

Girl you fulfill my fantasy

Touched a dream

Said we rewrote the book of love making history

Touched a dream

Last night you brought my dreams to reality
Now last night, I could have sworn I saw an eagle spread his wings

Last night, I saw the world living in peace and harmony

While we were making love, I felt my soul being set free
Last night I

Touched a dream

You were here with me

Last night I

Touched a dream

And you fulfill my fantasy

Touched a dream

Touched a dream

Ooh yeah, girl you brought my dreams to reality
After the rain comes the rainbow

The sun will shine after the storm

Oh yes it will and Mother Nature guarantees

Jumped the mountain and touched the sky

Over the sea baby we can fly

When we made love I see the flowers the trees the birds the bees
Last night I touched a dream girl

Hit it hard from the back

Roll around on the front

I know you've heard a lot of tracks

But 12 Play is what you want

Just let me call the studio

Then we can go all night

Girl I hope you can hang

Cause I'm horny as hell tonight
One

Taking off your Secrets with my teeth

Two

Slightly rough to let you know it's about to get kinky

Three

Blind your eyes, then I walk you to my bedroom

Four

Now open your eyes

Surprise you've entered twelve play two
Stop

We need to catch our breath

We've been going for a while

It's been about two hours

And we're still going round for round

The water's getting cold

And the movie's going off

This is how we do in TP-2
Five

I'm about to take you for a ride

Now feel it come inside

Six

Baby it's as hard as a brick

Tell me can you feel this sh, sh, sh

Seven

That's when to slow it down

Cause I'm not ready to

Eight

We're almost at the peak

Cause I'm feeling tingly
Now flew your body like, what what, what

It's like diamonds with the cut cut, cut

The hottest out of your friends

The way you take it from me

Girl you put it on me like draws

Moaning when you talk

I'm about to tear your shit out

New millennium style
Nine

Lookin you in your eyes

As I'm about to do that thing

Ten

Then on down to your thighs

I'm gonna make you scream

Eleven

Now put your body on top of me

I'm about to grab your waist

Twelve

Now quick before we get to thirteen

Set it on my face
 


 

Trade in my life

Oh for you, oh yes, oh yes

Trade in my life for you
Sittin here wonderin how did things go wrong

Every night asking myself what happened to our happy home

Will I ever see you again, I need to know my friend

Now the past has gone away but tomorrow's on it's way

Though the sun is going down, I need you around

I'm willing to trade in my life
 
Now I'm sitting here

Reminiscing on what we used to share

And how we used to be such a happy pair, oh yeah

I cannot believe we've thrown it all away

Tell me will I see you again someday?
Now the past is gone away

But tomorrow's on it's way

Though the sun is going down

And I need you around - trade
 
We both know that we made a vow

Said we'd always be together

That our love would endure, yes

But now you're gone and I'm all alone

But I need you here and I'm willing to trade it
 
I mean it from the bottom of my heart

Tell me are you with me, are you willing to trade it
And I don't even have to think about it twice

Hey, I'll trade it

Somebody help me say I'll trade it

Until you return to me

I'm gonna stay on my hands and knees

And when I see you I'm gonna stand up

And reach my hands out to you, and trade it
Said I love my music and I love my fans

But I've got to step back

Look at this thing like it sure enough is

Tell me do you remember when we used to say

Everything is in their love tell me
What does it profit a man

To gain the world and lose his soul?

I'm gonna trade it to be with you
 


Seven o'clock in the morning

And the rays from the sun wakes me

I'm stretchin and yawnin 
In a bed that don't belong to me

And a voice yells, "Good morning, darlin", from the bathroom

Then she comes out and kisses me

And to my surprise, she ain't you
Now I've got this dumb look on my face

Like, what have I done?

How could I be so stupid to be have laid here til the morning sun?

Lost the track of time

Oh, what was on my mind?

From the club, went to her home

Didn't plan to stay that long
Here I am, quickly tryin to put on my clothes

Searching for my car keys

Tryin to get on up out the door

Then she stretched her hands in front of it

Said, "You can't go this way"

Looked at her, like she was crazy

Said, "Woman move out my way"

Said, "I got a wife at home"

She said, "Please don't go out there"

"Lady, I've got to get home"

She said, her husband was comin up the stairs
"Shh, shh, quiet

Hurry up and get in the closet"

She said, "Don't you make a sound

Or some shit is going down"

I said, "Why don't I just go out the window?"

"Yes, except for one thing, we on the 5th floor"

"Shit think, shit think, shit quick, put me in the closet"

And now I'm in this darkest closet, tryin to figure out

Just how I'm gonna get my crazy ass up out this house
Then he walks in and yells, "I'm home"

She says, "Honey, I'm in the room"

Walks in there with a smile on his face

Sayin  "Honey, I've been missin you"

She hops all over him

And says, "I've cooked and ran your bath water?

I'm tellin you now, this girl's so good that she deserves an Oscar
Throws her in the bed

And start to snatchin her clothes off

I'm in the closet, like man, what the fuck is going on?

You're not gonna believe it

But things get deeper as the story goes on

Next thing you know, a call comes through on my cell phone

I tried my best to quickly put it on vibrate

But from the way he act, I could tell it was too late

He hopped up and said, "There's a mystery going on

And I'm gonna solve it"

And I'm like, "God please, don't let this man open this closet?
He walks in the bathroom

And looks behind the door

She says, "Baby, come back to bed"

He says, "Bitch say no more"

He pulls back the shower curtain

While she's biting her nails

Then he walks back to the room

Right now, I'm sweating like hell

Checks under the bed

Then under the dresser

He looks at the closet

I pull out my Beretta

He walks up to the closet

He goes up to the closet

Now he's at the closet

Damn he's opening the closet?
 


Believe it or not, I just started laughing

Shaking my head and just kept on laughing

Thinking about all the things I had been through that day

Then she cries, "What? Why do you have that smile upon your face?"
Then I laughed out, said

"Thinking about all the things I been through"

She wipes her nose and she sniffles and laughs out

"I been through it too"
Then I start laughing again

And she start laughing more

Then next thing you know we're both are

Cracking up on the floor
She laughs out, "I can't believe

This idiot really answered my phone"

Now meanwhile Twon just got out of prison

And he's on his way home
Then she yells, "Baby, I'm sorry for all the lies and all the bore"

Then I say, "Girl, just wait till I tell all the drama

That I been dealing with"

She laughs, "I wanna hear it all"
Then I laugh and say, "Baby, first of all

I got a hangover, been trapped in the closet

Slept with who knows, threatened to kill a pastor"

She says, "What? Baby know now he had a lover turns out

To be a gay guy"

She says, "Damn, you been through a lot, plus I got a ticket"
Meanwhile, the police, he turns around

Just out of concern, comes back to the house

Then he pulls up in the driveway

My car's parked with the lights on

Then he goes around the back way

He hear the dog barking like somethings wrong
He gets to the back door

And discovers it's been broken in

He looks around, pulls his gun out

Then he proceeds in
Meanwhile, we're laughing and laughing and laughing

From his perspective he thinks that somebody's crying

He gets closer to the bedroom and he would swear

That somebody's coughing and sighing
Meanwhile, we in the bedroom laughing

As I'm trying to continue to explain

She yells out, "Sylvester your killing me"

I said, "I swear baby it went that way
Then next thing you know he bust up in the room

And say, "Mothafucker freeze"

And then I looked back up at him and said

"Wait your that damn police"
Then she scream, "Baby, I mean James"

She says "Everything is cool"

And then he yells, "Gwendolyn, I got this

I know your sick and tired of this fool"
Then I stood up, started walking

Toward him screaming, "Man, get out my house"

Then he yells, "Freeze"

She scream, "Please"
Then I pull my biretta out

Then she cried out "Sylvester please don't"

Then I started thinking about him making love to her

He said, "Man, put the gun on the floor"

I can't stop thinking about him and her
I slowly put the gun down

And then I put my hands up

He winked at me and smiled

And that is when I went nuts
Hopped all over him round the gun

She screaming, "Settle down"

Going all around the room

Both hands on the gun and all of a sudden pow
 


Seven o'clock in the morning

And the rays from the sun wakes me

I'm stretchin and yawnin 
In a bed that don't belong to me

And a voice yells, "Good morning, darlin", from the bathroom

Hurry up and get in the closet"

She said, "Don't you make a sound

Or some shit is going down"

I said, "Why don't I just go out the window?"

"Yes, except for one thing, we on the 5th floor"

"Shit think, shit think, shit quick, put me in the closet"

And now I'm in this darkest closet, tryin to figure out

Just how I'm gonna get my crazy ass up out this house
Then he walks in and yells, "I'm home"

She says, "Honey, I'm in the room"

Walks in there with a smile on his face

Sayin  "Honey, I've been missin you"

She hops all over him

And says, "I've cooked and ran your bath water?

I'm tellin you now, this girl's so good that she deserves an Oscar
Throws her in the bed

And start to snatchin her clothes off

I'm in the closet, like man, what the fuck is going on?

You're not gonna believe it

But things get deeper as the story goes on

Next thing you know, a call comes through on my cell phone

I tried my best to quickly put it on vibrate

But from the way he act, I could tell it was too late

He hopped up and said, "There's a mystery going on

And I'm gonna solve it"

And I'm like, "God please, don't let this man open this closet?
He walks in the bathroom

And looks behind the door

She says, "Baby, come back to bed"

He says, "Bitch say no more"

He pulls back the shower curtain

While she's biting her nails

Then he walks back to the room

Right now, I'm sweating like hell

Checks under the bed

Then under the dresser

He looks at the closet

I pull out my Beretta

He walks up to the closet

He goes up to the closet

Now he's at the closet

Damn he's opening the closet?
 


Seven o'clock in the morning

And the rays from the sun wakes me

I'm stretchin and yawnin 
In a bed that don't belong to me

And a voice yells, "Good morning, darlin", from the bathroom

Then she comes out and kisses me

And to my surprise, she ain't you
Now I've got this dumb look on my face

Like, what have I done?

How could I be so stupid to be have laid here til the morning sun?

Lost the track of time

Oh, what was on my mind?

From the club, went to her home

Didn't plan to stay that long
Here I am, quickly tryin to put on my clothes

Searching for my car keys

Tryin to get on up out the door

Then she stretched her hands in front of it

Said, "You can't go this way"

Looked at her, like she was crazy

Said, "Woman move out my way"

Said, "I got a wife at home"

She said, "Please don't go out there"

"Lady, I've got to get home"

She said, her husband was comin up the stairs
"Shh, shh, quiet

Hurry up and get in the closet"

She said, "Don't you make a sound

Or some shit is going down"

I said, "Why don't I just go out the window?"

She hops all over him

And says, "I've cooked and ran your bath water?

I'm tellin you now, this girl's so good that she deserves an Oscar
Throws her in the bed

And start to snatchin her clothes off

I'm in the closet, like man, what the fuck is going on?

You're not gonna believe it

But things get deeper as the story goes on

Next thing you know, a call comes through on my cell phone

I tried my best to quickly put it on vibrate

But from the way he act, I could tell it was too late

He hopped up and said, "There's a mystery going on

And I'm gonna solve it"

And I'm like, "God please, don't let this man open this closet?
He walks in the bathroom

And looks behind the door

She says, "Baby, come back to bed"

He says, "Bitch say no more"

He pulls back the shower curtain

While she's biting her nails

Then he walks back to the room

Right now, I'm sweating like hell

Checks under the bed

Then under the dresser

He looks at the closet

I pull out my Beretta

He walks up to the closet

He goes up to the closet

Now he's at the closet

Damn he's opening the closet?
 


Seven o'clock in the morning

And the rays from the sun wakes me

I'm stretchin and yawnin 
In a bed that don't belong to me

And a voice yells, "Good morning, darlin", from the bathroom

Then she comes out and kisses me

And to my surprise, she ain't you
Now I've got this dumb look on my face

Like, what have I done?

How could I be so stupid to be have laid here til the morning sun?

Lost the track of time

Oh, what was on my mind?

From the club, went to her home

Didn't plan to stay that long
Here I am, quickly tryin to put on my clothes

Searching for my car keys

Tryin to get on up out the door

Then she stretched her hands in front of it

Said, "You can't go this way"

Looked at her, like she was crazy

Said, "Woman move out my way"

Said, "I got a wife at home"

She said, "Please don't go out there"

"Lady, I've got to get home"

She said, her husband was comin up the stairs
"Shh, shh, quiet

Hurry up and get in the closet"

She said, "Don't you make a sound

Or some shit is going down"

I said, "Why don't I just go out the window?"

"Yes, except for one thing, we on the 5th floor"

"Shit think, shit think, shit quick, put me in the closet"

And now I'm in this darkest closet, tryin to figure out

Just how I'm gonna get my crazy ass up out this house
Then he walks in and yells, "I'm home"

She says, "Honey, I'm in the room"

Walks in there with a smile on his face

Sayin  "Honey, I've been missin you"

She hops all over him

And says, "I've cooked and ran your bath water?

I'm tellin you now, this girl's so good that she deserves an Oscar

And I'm like, "God please, don't let this man open this closet?
He walks in the bathroom

And looks behind the door

She says, "Baby, come back to bed"

He says, "Bitch say no more"

He pulls back the shower curtain

While she's biting her nails

Then he walks back to the room

Right now, I'm sweating like hell

Checks under the bed

Then under the dresser

He looks at the closet

I pull out my Beretta

He walks up to the closet

He goes up to the closet

Now he's at the closet

Damn he's opening the closet?
 


Seven o'clock in the morning

And the rays from the sun wakes me

I'm stretchin and yawnin 
In a bed that don't belong to me

And a voice yells, "Good morning, darlin", from the bathroom

Then she comes out and kisses me

And to my surprise, she ain't you
Now I've got this dumb look on my face

Like, what have I done?

How could I be so stupid to be have laid here til the morning sun?

Lost the track of time

Oh, what was on my mind?

From the club, went to her home

Didn't plan to stay that long
Here I am, quickly tryin to put on my clothes

Searching for my car keys

Tryin to get on up out the door

Then she stretched her hands in front of it

Said, "You can't go this way"

Looked at her, like she was crazy

Said, "Woman move out my way"

Said, "I got a wife at home"

She said, "Please don't go out there"

"Lady, I've got to get home"

She said, her husband was comin up the stairs
"Shh, shh, quiet

Hurry up and get in the closet"

She said, "Don't you make a sound

Or some shit is going down"

I said, "Why don't I just go out the window?"

"Yes, except for one thing, we on the 5th floor"

"Shit think, shit think, shit quick, put me in the closet"

And now I'm in this darkest closet, tryin to figure out

Just how I'm gonna get my crazy ass up out this house
Then he walks in and yells, "I'm home"

She says, "Honey, I'm in the room"

Walks in there with a smile on his face

Sayin  "Honey, I've been missin you"

She hops all over him

And says, "I've cooked and ran your bath water?

I'm tellin you now, this girl's so good that she deserves an Oscar
Throws her in the bed

And start to snatchin her clothes off

I'm in the closet, like man, what the fuck is going on?

You're not gonna believe it

But things get deeper as the story goes on

Next thing you know, a call comes through on my cell phone

I tried my best to quickly put it on vibrate

But from the way he act, I could tell it was too late

He hopped up and said, "There's a mystery going on

And I'm gonna solve it"

And I'm like, "God please, don't let this man open this closet?
He walks in the bathroom

And looks behind the door

She says, "Baby, come back to bed"

He says, "Bitch say no more"

He pulls back the shower curtain

He says, "Bitch, say no more"

He pulls back the shower curtain

While she's biting her nails

Then he walks back to the room

Right now, I'm sweating like hell

Checks under the bed

Then opens the dresser

He looks at the closet

I pull out my Beretta

He walks up to the closet

He comes up to the closet

Now he's at the closet

Now he's opening the closet...
 


He looks around the kitchen, and says, Something is really weird

And she says, Why do you say that?

He says, Cos you keep tryin to get me out of here

He said, Ever since I been in this house

Your face has went from white to red

And remember when I first walked through the door

You acted like you had seen a ghost from the dead?
Then he says, Girl if you hidin something, I'm gonna be so mad

Then he hears something fallin, he says, What the fuck was that?

She said, It sounds like it came from upstairs, sounds like the plumbing

He said, Woman that sound did not come from upstairs!

I'll be damned if you're not up to something!"
He said, "Now the sound that I just heard, it came from this kitchen

And then he looks over by the stove, while shes easin over by the dishes

And then he walks over to the refrigerator and pushes it back

And then he looks her in her face

Looks like shes about to have a heart attack

Then he notices the pie on the counter, one slice is missing

Now the storys gettin scary, cos he comes to realize

That Bridget is allergic to cherries
Then he slowly looks up at her, and now her face is red as hell

He's breathing real hard, and movin closer

She says, Hon, you don't look so well

And then he says, Move

She says, No

He says, Move

She says, No!

Bitch move!

She moves
 


Now he's staring at me like

As if he was staring in the mirror

She yells honey let me explain

He says you don't have to go no further

I can clearly see what's going on

Behind my back, in my bed, in my home

Then I said wait a minute now hold on

I said Mister we can work this out

She said honey don't lose control

Tried to get him to calm down

He says ho I should've known

That you would go and do some bogus shit up in my house

But the christian in me gave you the benefit of the doubt

I said we need to resolve this

And he stepped to me

I'm like whoa

There's a reason I'm in this closet

He says yeah what are you talking ?clothes?

I met this girl at the Pajis club

And she told me she didn't have a man

Then he said man please I'd kill you

If you didn't have that gun in your hand

And then I said but your chick chose me

He said don't give me that mack shit please

His phone goes off and then

Things get a little more interesting

He steps a little closer

I point my gun and say I'm not the one you're after

He says it's not my bet you didn't know my man

Did she tell you I was a pastor?

I said well good that's better right

Why can't we handle this Christian like

And I started to put the gun down

Til I saw his face still had a frown

She started crying saying baby I'm sorry

Then he said baby not as sorry as you're gonna be

I started inching out

He says no I want you to see this

Said I gotta get out this house

He said not til I reveal my secret

I'm like what is going on inside his head

Then he takes his phone and calls somebody up and says

Hello?

Hello?

Baby?

Yeah

Turn the car around

What's going on? What's wrong?

I just need for you to get right back here now

Click
He looks at me and says

Well, since we're all coming out the closet

I'm not about to be the only one broken hearted

She said what do you mean?

He said just wait and see

I said somebody better talk to me

And then his phone rings

He picks up

And somebody says sweetheart I'm downstairs

And he's like I'll buzz you up

I'm on the fifth floor hurry take the stairs

And I'm like who is this mystery lady that you're talking to

He says in time you both will know the shocking truth

Baby this is something I've been wanting to get off my chest for a long, long time

Then I said I'm gon shoot you both if you don't say what's on your mind

He says wait I hear somebody coming up the stairs

And I'm looking at the door

He says I think you better sit down in a chair

I said I'm going to count to four

One

He says mister wait

Two

She says please don't shoot

Three

He says don't shoot me

Four

She screams

Then a knock at the door

The gun's in my hand

He opens the door

I'll be god fucked up like shit fuck it a man comin to fuck me up and give me head fuck

He opens the door, I can't believe it's a man
 


Believe it or not, I just started laughing

Shaking my head and just kept on laughing

Thinking about all the things I had been through that day

Then cries what why do you have that smile upon your face
Then I laughed out said thinking

About the things that I've been through

She wipes her nose and she sniggles

And laughs out I've been through it too
Then I start laughing again and she start laughing more

Then next thing you know we both are cracking up on the floor

She laughs I can't believe this idiot really answered my phone

Now meanwhile Twon just got out of prison and he's on his way home
Then she laughs baby I'm sorry

For all the lies and all the bullshit

Then I say girl just wait till I tell you

All the drama that I've been dealing with
She laughs I wanna hear it all

Then I laugh and say baby first of all

I got a hangover, been trapped in the closet

Slept who knows, threatened to kill a pastor
She says, what baby

This is no lie he had a lover turns out to be a gay guy

She says damn you've been through a lot

Plus I gotta ticket
Meanwhile the policeman he turns around

Just out of concern comes back to the house

Then he pulls up in the driveway

My cars parked crooked with the lights on
Then he goes around the back way

He hear the dogs barking like somethings wrong

He gets to the backdoor and discover its been broken in

He looks around, pulls his gun out, then proceeds in
Meanwhile were laughing and laughing and laughing

But from his perspective he thinks somebodies crying

He gets closer to the bedroom

And he would swear that somebody was coughing and sighing
Meanwhile were in the bedroom laughing

As I'm trying to continue to explain

She yells out Sylvester your killing me

Said I swear that it went that way
Then next thing you know he bust up in the room

Said bitch mutherfucker freeze

And then I looked back up at him

And said wait your that damn police
Then she screams baby

I mean James she says everything is cool

And then he yells Gwendolyn I got this

I know your sick and tired off this fool
Then I stood up start walking toward him

Screaming man get out my house

Then he yells freeze she scream

Please and I pulled my barretta out
She cried out, Sylvester please don't

Visions of him making love to her

He said man put the gun on the floor

I can't thinking about him and her
I slowly put the gun and then I put my hands up.

He winked at me and smiled

And that is when I went nuts

Hopped all over him grabbed the gun
She screaming settle down

Going all around both handling the gun

Then all of a sudden pow
 


There's total silence, blood everywhere

And confusion on their faces as they continue to stare

Then Gwen starts shakin and cryin  screamin  "What did you do?!"

And then the policeman looks at me and screams

"See, now I warned you!"
Then he starts pacing the floor screamin 
"God, what have we done here?!"

And she rushed to the door, blood on her hands screamin 
"There goes your whole career"
Meanwhile, I'm freakin out sayin  "We gotta do somethin 
And gotta do somethin quick"

Then he picks up the gun and says, "I have a wife at home

I can't have no cause of this"

She says, "James, I can't believe you just said what you said

Cause that's not what you was sayin when your ass was in my bed"
Then I said, "Get married later, but right now we gotta use our heads

First of all, did anybody think to check if the man was alive or dead?"

Then he looks at her, she looks at me

I look at them and we look at him

Meanwhile, Gwen's about to have a nervous breakdown

The way she's shakin and cryin And then she screams, "You bastards! You've killed my brother!"

And then I said, "Gwen, wait a minute, I didn't"

She says, "No, you killed my brother!"

She said, "He just got out of prison, he's been through a lot

He was talking about changin his life and everything

And to come home and get shot"
And I said, "Baby, it wasn't my fault, this man had a gun on me

And besides, how was I to know that you was getting down

With this crooked ass policeman?"

And he says, "Wait a minute," I say, "No, you wait a minute!"

And then I say, "Man, this is my wife

We had a life until you butted up in it!"
She cried out, "Sylvester, now hold on! Even though he was in our home Let's not forget the fact that you was out there

Creepin in another man's home"
Twan starts coughin 
And she says, "Twan! Oh my god! Baby brother, are you okay?"

He looks up at her and says, "I'm not gonna die, at least not today"

And then he asks what happened, and says, "Why did I get shot?

Sylvester what is this policeman doin here?"

And I said, "Go on, tell him cop"
He says, "Son, we gotta get you to a hospital

And take a look at that wound"

Twan says, "No, I'm okay, it's just my shoulder

All I need is a bathroom"

Now five minutes has gone by and they tellin 
Twan everything that happened

Twan says, "Fuck man, I would've been better off in prison"
And now somebody's banging at the door and I'm like

"Aw no! Here we go again!"

Thinkin out loud to myself, sayin  "When is this shit gonna end?!"

Then Gwendolyn looks at me and says, "Baby, you got that?"

And I say, "No!"

She says, "Why?" And I said, "Because I'm not

Openin up another motherfuckin door!"
And the cop says, "Gwen, I'll get it"

Then looks at me and says, "Man of the house, my ass!"

Then I say, "I'll get it, but whoever it is

I'm about to put their ass on blast!"
And then the policeman grabbed me

I snatched away and got my gun up off the floor

Then Twan says, "Man, that's what I'm talkin about!

Sylvester, point that shit toward the door!"
Then he snatches the policeman's gun and says

"Officer, arrest me later"

I count to three, Twan opened the door and it's

Rosy the nosy neighbor
Ooh, with a spatula in her hand

Like that's gon do something against them guns

It's Rosy the nosy neighbor

Chorus
 


I was riding in my car one day

In the express lane rollin on the freeway

And suddenly the phone rings then I

Reached down beside me then I look

On the floor felt on the backseat

See I was drinking while I was driving

Never thinking bout what I was doing

I turned around and before I knew it

Here comes this truck now
Doctor said don't think he gonna make it

Family said make the funeral arrangements

Unplug the machine he's gone now

Then told my wife to be strong now

Then a small voice said told me

If you promise to stop drinking

I surrendered on that day

Now for ten years I've been straight
You saved me  

Gave me a second chance

You saved me  

You saved me
Now I've been sitting in this chair

Waiting on the phone to ring

Praying up to God that someone will call

Me with a job opening

Cause it's been so hard for me

Month to month struggling to eat

But still there was no answer

I stop believing in his word and

Got so mad at him and

When somebody said God's good

I just laugh at em
But in the nick of time his blessing

Rain on me

By his grace the phone ring

A lady said were hiring and

That's when I knew
You saved me  
Now I was 18 out there on the block

Selling drugs

With a gun at my waist

And for people I had no love

See the streets was my home

Family and friends were all gone

Had no one to trust

And deep inside I was all alone

And a deal went bad one day

And it was enough to pause me

I was shot 4 times and before I

Knew it I was on my knees
Blood pushin out my body

My heart's beating faster don't know what I'm gonna do

I don't think I'm gonna last then

I begain to flash back on the things

I done in my past

Then I heard a small voice that said

I'll give you peace if you believe

I accepted Christ that day

Halilujah now I'm free
You saved me  
I was in the aisle of the grocery store

With a pain in my chest and I'm wondering

Where did it come from I got tested

And the results came back

And the doctor said I'm sorry but u got cancer

I could not beleive it so

I call my mama to calm my nerves
mama she got down on her knees

mama she said a prayer for me

mama just keep on thanking Jesus

mama he'll give you what you need

thank you Jesus

Now that was five years ago

I don't have that pain no more

Doc said you can go home

Cause all your cancer's gone
You saved me  
You saved me said you saved me

You saved me but you saved me

You saved me saaaved me

Gave me a second chance second chance

Halilujah saved me

Saved me saved me

Wooooooh You saved me
You gave me it was by grace You saved me

I'm so thankful that You looked down on me

Saw me standing there

I was at the end of my rope no where to go

And you gave me
No where to go and you saved me

I was down and out 2

I was doing drugs 2

I was running the streets 2

Never felt love

I was wilding out

You saved me

You stepped in ooh save me
You saved me
 


Oh yeah you know I had to do it

And I got my middle fingers up

And I'm in this bitch like turned out for what

Okay you're talking money and hoes U.O.E.N.O

I was so wrapped up in

All of the finer things

That I never took the time to show you

What you meant to me

Money, cars, and ice

Blingin off the clothes

I thought that I was hot

Until you turned cold

How could my success?

Go and deceive me

If I could turn it all back

Then all of this would be a dream to me
Ooh, ooh

Oh, hmm

Ooh, ooh

Baby, baby

If you saw me in church on Sundays

You could tell

I've learn my lesson well
Never said a prayer

Oh like this

Never shed a tear

Until it was you I missed

Never fell in love

Like a bottomless pit

I was so, so tough

Till you were up and outta here
My pride had me thinking

That being with me

You were blessed

Funny how you could ask for so little

And receive less

All of the fussing and fighting

Cause I was always gone

And even though I gave you a lame excuse

You still hung on

Oh I don't blame you for leaving me

But if I could turn it all back

This would be a dream to me
Ooh, ooh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Ooh, ooh

Baby, baby, baby

If you could see me in church on Sundays

You would say I've learned my lesson well
Never said a prayer

Never said a prayer like this no, no

Never shed a tear

Until it was you I missed

Never fell in love

Like a bottomless pit

I was so, so tough

Till you were up and outta here
Never said a prayer

Said a prayer like this baby

Never shed a tear

Until it was you I missed

Never fell in love

Like a bottomless pit

I was so, so tough

Till you were up and outta here
Never said a prayer

Said I never said a prayer like this no, no

Never shed a tear

To tough to shed a tear ooh baby

Never fell in love

They could take all my positions hey

Never said a prayer

Because love taught me a lesson baby, oh, oh

Never shed a tear

See I've got to have you back

Never fell in love

See I've got to have you back

See I've got to have you back

Never said a prayer

See I've got to have you back

See I've got to have you back

Never shed a tear

Got to have you, got to have you

Got to have you, got to have you

Never fell in love

Got to have you, got to have you

Got to have you, got to have you

Got to have you, hey oh

Never said a prayer

Never shed a tear

Never fell in love...

I'm sick and tired of the games you played

Every move I make your ass got something to say

Scandalize my name when you see it in the paper

Trying to turn it all around when it wasn't that way

Everybody is trying to figure me out

What the hell is wrong with y'all just let me live my life

I can't go one day without y'all in my face

Y'all done lost y'all minds if you don't hear what I say

Cops chase me when I'm standing still

You know I ain't done shit wrong so why you want me in your cell

You don't like my songs well it pays the bills

And you cut me down cause I keep it real

Sometimes I want to fly far away from here

To another place it ain't worth these tears

Sometimes at night when I close my eyes

I know the haters are busy making up hater lies

Sometimes I laugh trying to keep from crying

If I was plain out of love then tell me who could I trust

See I work so hard just to get ahead

If it wasn't for God I'd probably be dead

Sometimes I think y'all trying to pull me down

But y'all wasting your time I got you haters figured out

If yo had your way it'd be lock and key

Everywhere I go trouble follows me

Where the hell is my father shit it hurts sometimes

There's a hole in me and it rocks my mind
Forgive me father for I have sinned

When was your last confession
His true fears he left without a care

And that was more than I could bare

When you need my help I never tell you no

When I need your love you got somewhere to go

I'm getting sick of this shit but I'm not gonna quit

I've come too far gotta keep my pockets thick

I get mad as hell but that's ok

Kick off these shoes cause I'm here to stay

I gotta let you know got no time to play

So feel me and all that you hear me say

What I'm building up you can't tear it down

cause it's built on solid Rockland ground

We don't die, we multiply, hit after hit, living platinum style

Keep my head up high, looking toward the sky

Nothing inmy view, hey I can fly

Y'all just hate, I can't take no more

And if you feel me raise your hand and show
This is what I feel, ooh, this is what I feel

Feel me, feel me, feel me, hey, hey feel, woo

Westside tell me can you feel me, hey, oh

Eastside tell me can you feel me, whoa, oh south

Southside tell me can you feel me

Feel me, feel me

I'm standing here looking in the mirror

Saying "damn" to myself

I should have known the day would come

That she would find somebody else

And all the things I took her through

Shit, I shouldn't have lasted this long

Now I'm at this telephone booth calling Tyrone
Cause when a woman's fed up

No matter how you beg, no

It ain't nothing you can do about it nothing you can do about it

It's like running out of love

No matter what you say, no

And then it's too late to talk about it too late to talk about it
Now let's talk about how it all goes down

I used to make love to you daily

When the night fell, the same

And anytime that you were hurt

I could feel your pain

And if I had a dollar

It was yours, yeah ooh, yeah

And whenever we would go out

I would front the bill

But now the up is down

And the silence is sound

I hurt you too, too many times

Now I can't come around
Cause when a woman's fed up

No matter how you beg, no

It ain't nothing you can do about it nothing you can do about it

Oh no, it's just like running out of love

No matter what you say, no

And then it's too late to talk about it too late to talk about it
Oh yeah, oh yeah, la la da da

La

La da da da da

La da da da da

La

Oh yeah, la da da da da

La

Oh, ah, listen, if you don't want to find out the hard way

Then listen to this song while the record plays
When a woman's fed up

Mama taught me along time ago

It ain't nothing you can do about it nothing you can do about it

Oh no, it's like running out of love

No matter what you say, no

Then it's too late to talk about it too late to talk about it
Yeah

You can cry a river

Till an ocean starts to form, yeah

But she will always remember

Cause she's a woman scorned

And if you ever get her back

It will never be the same

She's cuttin the corners of her eyes

Every time she see your face

Now your trust is out the door

She don't want you no more

You used to tell your boys, not me

And she would always be there for you

If you had took the time to see

What that woman meant to you

Is what the mirror said to me, whoa

She was raised in Illinois

Right outside of Chicago

Some of the best cookin you ever had

Yes, it was and I miss her

Hey woman, if you're listening

Said I miss you baby, whoa, whoa, oh yeah
 


When I wake up in the morning time and see the sun I say

Hallelujah, thank you Jesus for waking me up today

I think about his goodness and the wonderful things he's done

Forgiving me, setting me free and casting my sins away

And soon as I was about to fall you stepped right in on time

Picked me up, and let me know you had nothing but love for me

And those lonely nights when I thought that I gonna lose my mind my mind

Lord, You were my company
And now I feel joy when I think about you

I feel strength when I think about you

No pain when I think about you

And no rain when I think about you

I get glad when I think about you

And raise my hands when I think about you

Shout your name when I think about you

When I think about you
And in the midst of the storm you were the shelter in my life

Even though I was doing wrong and even though I fell off

No-one can help me out, the way you helped me whenever I was in need

When trouble was chasing, I was weak mmm you kept your hands on me

My God you sacrifised you life that I might live for eternity

Despite my faults, you heard my cry yes you did and forgave my inequity

No-one can understand, the way you understand when it comes to my heart

Lord you gave me a brand new start
And now I feel joy when I think about you

Feel strength when I think about you

There is no pain when I think about you

No rain when I think about you

And begin to pray when I think about you Lord help me

Then I see the light when I think about you

Startin to shine right through when I think about you

All my bros, chedder and glamorous things

Copped a few cars

A crib with a east and west wing

Of how to get it and keep it

How to prey on my weakness

cause I want the p-you-s-s-why

Got a lotta niggas wonderin it ain't just I

Gotta keep ya cash comin and that's on my life

If it wasn't for the money and the things I got

Shit, she probably wouldn't like me

If it wasn't for the money, cars and movies stars and jewels

Pull up in them hot cars go and buy the whole bar nigga

Niggas couldn't walk a mile in my shoes

Niggas don't possess the heart that I do

And it's a wonder that I'm still here

Thought I was gone but I'm still here

And all you bitches that left me here

If it wasn't for the money, cars and movies stars and jewels

And all these things I got

Chorus

All around the world is Christmas 3 x

And I'm so glad to be

Sharing peace and harmony with you.
Looking out of the window

Seeing the winter white snow.

A kiss under the mistle toe

I see the angels halo
I open my eyes and to my surprise

All around the world is Christmas 3 x

And I'm so glad to be

Sharing peace and harmony with you.
Bridge

A child is born unto a sub king.

So, joy to the world

Woman , man , boy , and girl

For it is love that this Christmas brings
All around the world is Christmas 3 x

And I'm so glad to be

Sharing peace and harmony with you.

Another day has gone

I'm still all alone

How could this be

You're not here with me

You never said goodbye

Someone tell me why

Did you have to go

And leave my world so cold
Everyday I sit and ask myself

How did love slip away

Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone

For I am here with you

Though you're far away

I am here to stay
You are not alone

I am here with you

Though we're far apart

You're always in my heart

You are not alone
All alone

Asking me to come

And hold you in my arms

I can hear your prayers

Your burdens I will bear

But first I need your hand

So forever can begin
Everyday I sit and ask myself

How did love slip away

Then something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone

For I am here with you

Though you're far away

I am here to stay

For you are not alone

I am here with you

Though we're far apart

Though you're far away

I am here to stay

You are not alone

You're always in my heart
You are not alone

You're always in my heart
For you are not alone

I was riding in my car one day

In the express lane rollin on the freeway

And suddenly the phone rings then I

Reached down beside me then I look

On the floor felt on the backseat

See I was drinking while I was driving

Never thinking bout what I was doing

I turned around and before I knew it

Here comes this truck now
Doctor said don't think he gonna make it

Family said make the funeral arrangements

Unplug the machine he's gone now

Then told my wife to be strong now

Then a small voice said told me

If you promise to stop drinking

I surrendered on that day

Now for ten years I've been straight
You saved me  

Gave me a second chance

You saved me  

You saved me
Now I've been sitting in this chair

Waiting on the phone to ring

Praying up to God that someone will call

Me with a job opening

Cause it's been so hard for me

Month to month struggling to eat

But still there was no answer

I stop believing in his word and

Got so mad at him and

When somebody said God's good

I just laugh at em
But in the nick of time his blessing

Rain on me

By his grace the phone ring

A lady said were hiring and

That's when I knew
You saved me  
Now I was 18 out there on the block

Selling drugs

With a gun at my waist

And for people I had no love

See the streets was my home

Family and friends were all gone

Had no one to trust

And deep inside I was all alone

And a deal went bad one day

And it was enough to pause me

I was shot 4 times and before I

Knew it I was on my knees
Blood pushin out my body

My heart's beating faster don't know what I'm gonna do

I don't think I'm gonna last then

I begain to flash back on the things

I done in my past

Then I heard a small voice that said

I'll give you peace if you believe

I accepted Christ that day

Halilujah now I'm free
You saved me  
I was in the aisle of the grocery store

With a pain in my chest and I'm wondering

Where did it come from I got tested

And the results came back

And the doctor said I'm sorry but u got cancer

I could not beleive it so

I call my mama to calm my nerves
mama she got down on her knees

mama she said a prayer for me

mama just keep on thanking Jesus

mama he'll give you what you need

thank you Jesus

Now that was five years ago

I don't have that pain no more

Doc said you can go home

Cause all your cancer's gone
You saved me  
You saved me said you saved me

You saved me but you saved me

You saved me saaaved me

Gave me a second chance second chance

Halilujah saved me

Saved me saved me

Wooooooh You saved me
You gave me it was by grace You saved me

I'm so thankful that You looked down on me

Saw me standing there

I was at the end of my rope no where to go

And you gave me
No where to go and you saved me

I was down and out 2

I was doing drugs 2

I was running the streets 2

Never felt love

I was wilding out

You saved me

You stepped in ooh save me
You saved me
 


Everyday and night I pray

Love will swing you back this way

Life without you here with me

Ain't the same without you G
Baby hear me, I never meant to hurt you

Baby come and talk to me

Let me know what's on your mind

Every time I see you

You're running from me all the time
Baby hear me, I never meant to hurt you

I only wanted you to be happy

You to have the best of things

To be down with me, baby

Cause your lovin  it's so good
You're giving me the run-around

Thought our love was going down

Baby don't you know

That I'm down until the day I die

Baby hear me, never meant to hurt you

Now you know I'll never do anything to hurt you

Cause baby I love you
Every night and day I pray

Your love returns

Oh I'd give my life

If it would only make you happy
 

Sittin reminiscin on when you started dissin 
Spittin in faces in public places

Rolexes with faces had you chipper for months

Made some dough, did some shows, now you're starting to front

Smokin blunts on the veranda with Amanda

She's fillin your head with he said, she said

Poppa doin this, Poppa doin that

But don't tell him I said it cause my Jeep might get wetted

Forget it, go on take her word like the Koran

Y'all stay friends, I'll stay and smoke Phil Benzs

Honeysuckle sets, Biggie secret pyjama sets

You were the Reebok vandal, now you were Chanel sandals

I made you, why would I play you?

Think about it while the streets you roam

It's all peas and crispies in the fridge when you get home
 

You to be, be happy

You to have the best of things

Baby everything you want it for baby

You to be down with me

So give me that ass back baby

Cause your lovin is so good, so damn good, babe
Everyday and night I pray love will swing you back this way

Life without you here with me ain't the same without you G
